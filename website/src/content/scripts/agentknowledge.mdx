# Alith Agent Integration

## Connecting Knowledge Sources to Alith Agents

Alith agents can directly leverage the structured knowledge files produced by the knowledge scraping system. This integration enables agents to access up-to-date information without requiring manual updates or constant API calls to external sources.

### Integration Overview

The knowledge scraping system outputs standardized JSON files that Alith agents can consume in various ways:

1. **Direct File Access**: Agents can read and parse the JSON files directly
2. **Knowledge API**: Using the knowledge as an API endpoint 
3. **Memory Integration**: Importing the knowledge into the agent's long-term memory store

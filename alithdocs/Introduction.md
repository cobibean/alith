Why Alith
In LazAI, we believe that AI Agent is not a solution, but a goal we want to achieve and a problem that needs to be urgently solved. In the past 1 - 2 years, many AI Agent frameworks have emerged on the market, but they have not truly played the role of AI Agent. Restricted by the acquisition of internal data, the difficulty and cost of training and fine-tuning, as well as the high inference cost and low efficiency, AI Agents cannot be widely practiced, and the application scenarios are mostly concentrated in chatbots and so on. Therefore, we have launched the Alith AI Agent framework, which optimizes the model as much as possible on the basis of effectively utilizing data, improves the reasoning performance, and meets the needs of scene use.

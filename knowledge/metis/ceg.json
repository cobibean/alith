While our interactive lobby prototype provides a glimpse into the player experience, the true revolution lies in the meticulously crafted on-chain smart contracts and the robust Alith Architecture that power our innovative Proof of Play ecosystem.\nThis past month has been dedicated to building the immutable bedrock of Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 capabilities, focusing on decentralized ownership, verifiable progression, and a player-driven economy.\nFracture Point: The Game Skill, Strategy, and True Digital Ownership\nFracture Point is designed as a high-octane, tactical third-person shooter that demands precision, strategic thinking, and teamwork. We are building a fiercely competitive environment where your skill and dedication are not just recognized, but are fundamentally integrated into the game\u2019s core value system.\nPrepare for:\nIntense FPS Combat: Master diverse weapon loadouts and tactical maneuvers in dynamic, high-stakes engagements.\nDeep Customization: Personalize your agents and unique \u201cvariants\u201d, making your mark on the battlefield.\nCompetitive Progression: Climb verifiable leaderboards, earn genuine rewards, and truly own your in-game achievements.\nThe Proof of Play Revolution: Rewarding Skill On-Chain\nOur commitment to Proof of Play is the defining feature of Fracture Point. This is not a concept; it\u2019s a core, on-chain mechanism ensuring that your active engagement and skillful performance directly translate into verifiable, immutable value and progression within the game\u2019s ecosystem.\nHow Proof of Play works in Fracture Point, powered by our contracts:\nVerifiable Achievements: Through the GameAchievementRegistry.sol contract (which is part of our ClaimManager system), your significant in-game achievements and progression milestones are immutably recorded on the blockchain. This provides transparent, provable recognition for your dedication and skill.\nSkill-Based Rewards: Our FPToken (FracturePoint Token), serving as XP, is minted to players based on their in-game performance (e.g., in Rift events), authorized exclusively by our trusted Alith Oracle. This ensures that rewards are earned through genuine gameplay.\nOn-Chain Progression & Badges: Your accumulated FPToken (XP) can then be burned via the ClaimManager contract to claim unique Rank Badges (ERC-721 NFTs) from the RankBadge.sol contract, signifying your seasonal achievements and skill tier. This process is entirely on-chain, making your rank verifiable and owned.\nPlayer-Driven Ecosystem: This interconnected system ensures that the game\u2019s economy and value are directly influenced and shaped by the collective activity and skilled contributions of its player base.\nThis ensures Fracture Point rewards genuine skill, time invested, and proven performance, fostering a fair, transparent, and truly player-owned gaming experience.\nOur Core Architecture: Dedicated Smart Contracts and The Alith Framework\nThe true innovation behind Fracture Point lies in its robust, interconnected smart contracts and the strategic implementation of the Alith Architecture.\n1. The Alith Architecture: Our Tailored Blockchain Game Framework\nFracture Point leverages a bespoke implementation of the Alith Architecture. This is our comprehensive, modular framework meticulously designed to seamlessly integrate blockchain technology without compromising gameplay performance. It intelligently separates:\nOn-Chain Components: Our smart contracts (FPToken, RankBadge, ClaimManager) handle critical, immutable data like XP (FPToken) balances, Rank Badge (NFT) ownership, and verifiable achievements. This ensures decentralization, security, and provable ownership. The Alith Oracle acts as the trusted off-chain authority that bridges game outcomes to on-chain actions, such as distributing XP and authorizing badge claims.\nOff-Chain Backend: High-frequency game logic, real-time matchmaking, complex physics calculations, and volatile player statistics run on a performant off-chain backend. This guarantees a smooth, low-latency, and responsive gameplay experience, unburdened by blockchain transaction times and gas costs.\nSecure Interoperability: A robust and auditable communication layer ensures seamless and secure data flow between our contracts (governed by the Alith Oracle) and the off-chain game server.\n2. Fracture Point\u2019s Core Smart Contracts (Audited & Interconnected)\nWe have successfully designed, developed, and prepared for deployment the foundational smart contracts that power Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 economy and the Proof of Play mechanics. These contracts work in concert:\nFPToken.sol (FuturePoint Token) : This ERC-20 token represents XP within the Fracture Point ecosystem. It\u2019s designed specifically for in-game progression:\nMinted by Alith Oracle: Only the designated alithOracle can mint new FPToken to players (e.g., via distributeRiftXP) based on game outcomes.\nBurned by ClaimManager: The ClaimManager contract is uniquely authorized to burn FPToken (XP) from player balances when they claim Rank Badges, creating a clear utility and economic loop.\nNon-Transferable (Player-to-Player): Significantly, direct player-to-player transfers of FPToken are disabled. This ensures FPToken remains a pure XP/progression token, preventing speculative trading and focusing its value on in-game achievement.\nRankBadge.sol (Fracture Point Rank Badge) : This ERC-721 NFT contract represents unique, season-specific Rank Badges that players can earn.\nMinted by ClaimManager: Only the ClaimManager contract is authorized to mint new Rank Badges to players, ensuring badges are earned through the proper Proof of Play mechanism.\nImmutable On-Chain Proof: Each badge is a unique NFT, providing verifiable, immutable proof of a player\u2019s achievement for a given season and rank.\nClaimManager.sol : This is the central orchestrator contract, linking FPToken (XP) to Rank Badges (NFTs) and acting as the bridge to the Alith Oracle.\nManages Badge Claims: Players claim badges via ClaimManager, which then verifies their XP balance, burns the necessary FPToken from their account, and instructs RankBadge.sol to mint the new NFT.\nSeason Management: It tracks the currentSeason, ensuring players can only claim one badge per season.\nKarma Evaluation Requests: It facilitates requests for off-chain \u201cKarma\u201d evaluations by the Alith Oracle, hinting at deeper player behavior analysis.\nAlith Oracle Integration: It designates and relies on the alithOracle for authorizing badge claims and distributing rewards based on verified game data.\nThe code for these foundational contracts and the full Alith Architecture implementation can be reviewed in our public repository: https://github.com/SUPAMAN-dev/fracture-point-hyperhack\nYou can also verify our currently deployed contract addresses on the Hyperion testnet network: https://hyperion-testnet.metisdevops.link/\nFPToken Address: 0x4D23a7A2231624F1486CE0dE07C2fbF002f751B9\nClaimManager Address: 0x1Dab96d049e3ce56D51e6B0b149477927B897FFb\nRankBadge Address: 0xBB84D771f6aef01f00dEE45D9C9dF9C7ef9159e5\n(Note on GHC: While not currently on-chain, the fixed supply GHC currency, managed by multisig, will form the broader economic layer of Fracture Point. Its design ensures seamless future integration with our on-chain systems when the time is right, complementing the FPToken XP system.)\nLobby Prototype: The Player\u2019s Interactive Gateway\nComplementing this powerful blockchain backend, our functional lobby prototype provides the intuitive player-facing interface. It allows players to:\nSeamlessly navigate between game modes, customization options, and personal profiles.\nExperience a polished UI/UX that aligns with Fracture Point\u2019s futuristic theme.\nInteract with the foundational elements for future wallet integration, demonstrating how players will connect their on-chain assets to the game.\nLink to the prototype demo: https://youtu.be/aI_lQ6DcwEI\nEcosystem Interest: Strategic Offer from Plurality Web3\nAs a direct result of our development efforts during this Hyperion Hackathon, Fracture Point attracted partnership interest from leading Web3 infrastructure teams, most notably Plurality Web3, a startup pioneering embedded identity and authentication infrastructure for dApps.\nPlurality offered us a 12-month support package under their Partner Program, which includes:\n1:1 Engineering Support for seamless integration of user authentication and personalized in-game logic.\nFree infrastructure credits to cover authentication, user session tooling, and zkTLS-powered identity gating.\nUX Collaboration to co-design smooth onboarding flows without popups or clunky wallets particularly valuable for our casual-to-core player conversion goals.\nTheir outreach came after they reviewed Fracture Point\u2019s Hyperion-backed Proof of Play system and saw clear potential for adoption in competitive Web3 gaming.\nWe view this offer as both validation of our underlying architecture and a strategic complement to the low-cost, high-throughput infrastructure that Hyperion enables. These ecosystem synergies affirm that Fracture Point is not just a playable demo, but a platform being taken seriously by early infrastructure players.\nWhat\u2019s Next for Fracture Point?\nWith the core blockchain architecture, smart contracts, and the lobby interface firmly established, our immediate next steps are to integrate these powerful systems with the actual game engine to bring the full combat experience to life. This includes:\nBackend Game Logic Development: Building out the sophisticated off-chain systems for real-time matchmaking, secure player data management, and robust anti-cheat measures.\nGame Engine Integration: Connecting the lobby and backend systems to a game engine to render the immersive world and high-fidelity combat of Fracture Point.\nProof of Play Loop Refinement: Fully integrating in-game actions with our GameAchievementRegistry.sol via the Alith Oracle to ensure every skill-based action is verifiable and contributes to player progression and potential future GHC earnings.\nThis is an incredibly exciting time for Fracture Point.

                "comment": "Thanks for the kind words! Really appreciate the interest and great question.\nAt its core, Fracture Point is about creating a truly fair and transparent gaming ecosystem, where skill and effort are what get rewarded, not exploits or shortcuts.\nThat\u2019s exactly where Alith comes in.\nIn a typical game, especially online shooters, you always run into players who cheat, farm, or abuse systems to win. That destroys trust. What we\u2019re doing differently in Fracture Point is putting integrity at the heart of our reward system.\nAlith acts as the intelligent game moderator. It monitors every match every Rift through the Unity backend, evaluating outcomes, watching for exploits, and making sure only fair wins are rewarded. No shady leaderboard climbs. No rigged XP farming.\nThen, using its special permissions (as the alithOracle in our ClaimManager contract), Alith sends reward signals on-chain, issuing XP (FPToken) to players who truly earned them. That XP can then be used to claim seasonal badges and other progression rewards all verifiable and immutable.\nOver time, Alith learns from gameplay, gets smarter at spotting abusers, and helps us maintain a competitive but honest battlefield.\nThis is the first real merge of Web2-style live gameplay with Web3 reward mechanics, and we\u2019re doing it in a way that makes sense to real players. We want trust, transparency, and fun and Alith helps make that possible."

That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done with the prototype so far.\nWe\u2019re still a small team and looking for more developers to help bring the combat experience to life, especially engine-side. If you or anyone you know is excited by that vision, we\u2019d love to collaborate even sharing our project with friends helps a lot.

                "comment": "It is using Hyperion, L2 Metis, and can roughly do 250ms per txs, which is enough for a card game or turn-based player. I have made a game with Ephemeral Rollup on another blockchain with 10ms txs for Third person mmo game, and you can find it on my Twitter account. So this time, I\u2019m making card game battle which is addictive as well.\nPlayers earn token rewards, which they will use to compete back into the game. If you know the Uno Mobile game, it would be similar, and players with a lower amount of tokens will compete in different leagues. The gamified system is normal because this is a game where earning points through activities, leaderboards, etc. is a default feature for a game.\nAnyone can join directly through the browser, as it\u2019s a browser game with WebGPU. There\u2019s no need for installation, and fast load render on website, so you can open it immediately. The dev team can provide quick updates to due to the nature of browser development. Unlike other games built on engines such as Unity, they need to bake it into the application, so every iteration update is also overwhelming to make it a public update and involve the community even if it\u2019s unity-browser game."

Although I have built other 3D MMO-platformers in the browser, the game doesn\u2019t need to be at the AAA level to be addictive.\nUno Mobile has proven that a simple multiplayer card battle can be engaging for hours.\nI\u2019ve created a new type of board game. This game will have element-based battles (currently starting with 3-5 basic elements: fire, water, plant, thunder, ground). I\u2019m looking for feedback on the card battle idea, which should be ready by the end of June if the idea is still approved.\nSneakpeak of simple visual 3D cards here."

Previously the game idea was a bit different with joker\u2019s card but now, the gameplay will almost be like Uno mobile.\nThere will be no +2 or +4 wild cards. Instead, there will be elemental and black hole cards. A skillful player must remember all the cards that have been drawn, as they will be re-used.\nAfter that, we will make it into a blockchain multiplayer game with HYPERION. I\u2019m expecting to be done even before July, so everyone can immediately experience the HYPERION rollup.\nThen proceed to go mainnet before August. So everyone can compete with real token"

        "content": "Live Link: https://eduverse-ecru.vercel.app/\nProblem Statement\nStandardized education overlooks individual learning styles and paces, leading to disengagement and hindering student potential. Students and educators face the challenge of a rigid system that doesn\u2019t adapt to diverse needs, impacting learning outcomes.\nSolution Overview\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform offers a dynamic solution by employing a multi-agent system built on the Alith Agentic Framework. Specialized AI agents collaboratively analyze individual learning styles, curate tailored content, provide adaptive tutoring, and track progress in real time. This creates a uniquely personalized learning journey that adjusts to each student\u2019s needs and pace. By integrating diverse educational resources, the platform aims to enhance engagement, improve learning outcomes, and empower both students and educators.\nProject Description\nThis platform is designed to benefit a wide range of users across the educational landscape. Students of all ages, from kindergarten through higher education, can experience a more engaging and effective learning journey tailored to their specific needs. Educators can utilize the platform to enhance their teaching capabilities, gain deeper insights into student progress, and free up time for more individualized support.\nOn-Chain Components: A First-Class Implementation and Core Requirement for Blockchain Deployment\nOur AI-powered personalized education platform is not merely \u201cblockchain-enhanced\u201d \u2014 its core functionality and unique value proposition depend fundamentally on blockchain deployment via Hyperion. The decentralized, trustless, and immutable nature of blockchain\u2014particularly Hyperion\u2019s AI-optimized environment\u2014is essential to realizing our vision.\nVerifiable and Immutable Learning Profiles (On-Chain Data Storage)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain:\nStudent learning profiles\u2014containing hashed learning milestones, verified skills, and personalized path progress\u2014are recorded on Hyperion\u2019s MetisDB. Each profile includes:\nA unique student identifier\nImmutable logs of achievements\nReferences to off-chain AI agent interactions and curated learning content\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nTrustless Verification:\nCentralized educational records are prone to tampering and lack transparency. On-chain profiles offer tamper-proof, auditable records of a learner\u2019s journey\u2014verifiable by students, employers, and academic institutions alike.\nData Sovereignty:\nStudents retain full control of their learning data. On-chain metadata ensures ownership and transparency, unlike siloed centralized platforms.\nFoundation for AI Credentialing:\nImmutable learning progress forms the backbone for future AI-driven credentialing systems. AI-generated content, assessments, and learning paths can be reliably tied to a verifiable blockchain record.\nDecentralized Agent Coordination and Trust (Smart Contract Architecture)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain:\nAgent Registry & Capabilities:\nAll core agents (e.g., Learning Style Analyst, Content Curator, Personalized Tutor) are registered via smart contracts, with:\nUnique IDs\nDefined roles and permissions\nClear scope of data access and processing\nService Agreements & Orchestration Logic:\nSmart contracts manage agent workflows. For example:\nCompletion of a module may trigger the Progress Tracker\nUpon validation, the Personalized Tutor recommends next steps\nIncentive Mechanisms:\nToken-based rewards for learning milestones, community engagement, and future decentralized agent marketplaces.\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nTrustless Agent Interaction:\nIn a multi-agent system, blockchain ensures agent behaviors and interactions are transparent, verifiable, and not reliant on a centralized authority.\nGuaranteed Execution:\nSmart contracts enforce the deterministic execution of workflows, ensuring learning paths adapt in real time based on defined rules.\nImmutable Rules:\nEducational logic, access rights, and reward systems are hard-coded and transparent, fostering trust and accountability.\nAI Enablement via the Alith Agentic Framework\nWhat is Alith:\nAlith is a modular, multi-agent framework designed to power personalized learning by simulating human-like reasoning, memory, and collaboration among AI agents. It forms the intelligence layer of our platform, with deep interoperability with blockchain systems like Hyperion.\nKey Features of Alith:\nAgent Management:\nModular deployment of specialized AI agents:\nLearning Style Analyst\nContent Curator\nPersonalized Tutor\nProgress Tracker\nCollaboration Facilitator\nPersistent Memory:\nAgents maintain long-term memory and context across sessions, enhancing personalization.\nInter-Agent Communication:\nSecure and structured communication between agents, enabling dynamic, cooperative behavior.\nToolchain Access:\nSeamless access to external APIs, knowledge bases, and assessments.\nBlockchain Integration with Alith:\nOn-Chain Agent Registry:\nAll Alith agents are registered on-chain, with roles and capabilities enforced via smart contracts.\nCoordinated Workflow Execution:\nAlith agent interactions are triggered and validated by smart contracts, enabling a trustless education logic layer.\nToken-Driven Incentives:\nAgents\u2019 performance and student outcomes can be linked to on-chain reward systems to drive engagement and adaptive learning.\nPlanned Enhancements for Alith\nTo further improve the personalization, decentralization, and performance of the Alith framework, we are planning several critical upgrades:\n1. Decentralized Agent Marketplace\nAllow community developers to contribute new agents (e.g., specialized tutors or regional content curators)\nAgents will be published and authenticated on-chain with verifiable capabilities\nToken-based reputation and staking mechanisms will prevent misuse or malicious behavior\n2. Agent Fine-Tuning via Federated Learning\nSupport for secure, privacy-preserving personalization of agent behavior based on user feedback\nFine-tuning AI agents locally or within federated clusters, without compromising sensitive student data\n3. ZK-Verifiable Inference\nIntegrate zkML (zero-knowledge machine learning) to enable cryptographic verification of off-chain AI outputs\nThis allows validators and institutions to confirm an agent\u2019s decision (e.g., a test score) without exposing the underlying model or input\n4. Composable Agent Workflows\nEnable developers and educators to compose reusable learning workflows by chaining agents together via simple declarative schemas\nBacked by on-chain validation to ensure logical and pedagogical soundness\n5. Multilingual & Accessibility Agents\nCreate plug-and-play AI agents specialized in localization, translation, and neurodiverse learning strategies\nThese agents will leverage both on-chain registries and external toolchains for broader inclusion\nSecure, Real-Time AI Inference (Leveraging Hyperion\u2019s AI-Native Infrastructure)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain (or Hyperion-enabled):\nWhile most heavy AI workloads (e.g., model training, long-form inference) run off-chain via the Alith framework, Hyperion enables:\nLightweight on-chain AI inferences for rapid adaptation and scoring\nSmart contract\u2013verified AI outputs to ensure compliance with educational standards\nReal-time coordination between on-chain logic and off-chain AI services\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nVerifiable AI Outputs:\nAI-driven assessments and tutor recommendations can be validated on-chain, ensuring educational integrity and transparency\u2014unlike opaque, centralized AI systems.\nLow Latency, High Throughput:\nHyperion\u2019s parallel execution environment supports responsive, adaptive AI interactions critical to keeping learners engaged.\nScalable AI Coordination:\nIntegrating real-time AI decision-making into a decentralized, tamper-proof environment offers performance benefits without compromising trust or cost-efficiency.\nConclusion: Blockchain as the Foundation, Not a Feature\nDeploying on Hyperion transforms the platform from an advanced AI education app into a decentralized, verifiable, trust-minimized learning ecosystem. The blockchain is not an add-on \u2014 it is the bedrock of:\nTrust in student progress\nTransparency in agent interaction\nRobust, real-time AI performance\nData Sovereignty, Incentives, and Trust in Our Education Platform\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform leverages Hyperion\u2019s blockchain to give students true control over their learning data and foster a trusted educational environment.\nData Sovereignty\nWe achieve data sovereignty by giving students self-sovereign identities (SSIs) on Hyperion. Critical learning milestones and verified skills are recorded as immutable hashes on-chain (MetisDB), tied to the student\u2019s SSI. While detailed content stays off-chain, access is cryptographically linked to and controlled by the student. This means students decide who sees what data, creating a tamper-proof and verifiable record that\u2019s genuinely theirs, free from central control.\nToken Incentives\nWe use a utility token, LearnPoints ($LP), to drive engagement:\nLearn-to-Earn (L2E): Students earn $LP for completing modules, mastering skills, and consistent engagement.\nContribution Rewards: Educators and community members earn $LP for creating content, providing feedback, or participating in forums.\nStaking & Governance: $LP can be staked for premium features or used to vote on platform decisions, aligning community interests.\nThese tokens incentivize participation, build a strong community, and add tangible value to learning achievements.\nImportance of Trust and Transparency\nIn education, trust and transparency are paramount:\nLearner Trust: Students need to trust that their achievements are real and that AI decisions (like tutoring paths) are fair and unbiased.

                "comment": "Live Link: https://eduverse-ecru.vercel.app/\nProblem Statement\nStandardized education overlooks individual learning styles and paces, leading to disengagement and hindering student potential. Students and educators face the challenge of a rigid system that doesn\u2019t adapt to diverse needs, impacting learning outcomes.\nSolution Overview\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform offers a dynamic solution by employing a multi-agent system built on the Alith Agentic Framework. Specialized AI agents collaboratively analyze individual learning styles, curate tailored content, provide adaptive tutoring, and track progress in real time. This creates a uniquely personalized learning journey that adjusts to each student\u2019s needs and pace. By integrating diverse educational resources, the platform aims to enhance engagement, improve learning outcomes, and empower both students and educators.\nProject Description\nThis platform is designed to benefit a wide range of users across the educational landscape. Students of all ages, from kindergarten through higher education, can experience a more engaging and effective learning journey tailored to their specific needs. Educators can utilize the platform to enhance their teaching capabilities, gain deeper insights into student progress, and free up time for more individualized support.\nOn-Chain Components: A First-Class Implementation and Core Requirement for Blockchain Deployment\nOur AI-powered personalized education platform is not merely \u201cblockchain-enhanced\u201d \u2014 its core functionality and unique value proposition depend fundamentally on blockchain deployment via Hyperion. The decentralized, trustless, and immutable nature of blockchain\u2014particularly Hyperion\u2019s AI-optimized environment\u2014is essential to realizing our vision.\nVerifiable and Immutable Learning Profiles (On-Chain Data Storage)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain:\nStudent learning profiles\u2014containing hashed learning milestones, verified skills, and personalized path progress\u2014are recorded on Hyperion\u2019s MetisDB. Each profile includes:\nA unique student identifier\nImmutable logs of achievements\nReferences to off-chain AI agent interactions and curated learning content\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nTrustless Verification:\nCentralized educational records are prone to tampering and lack transparency. On-chain profiles offer tamper-proof, auditable records of a learner\u2019s journey\u2014verifiable by students, employers, and academic institutions alike.\nData Sovereignty:\nStudents retain full control of their learning data. On-chain metadata ensures ownership and transparency, unlike siloed centralized platforms.\nFoundation for AI Credentialing:\nImmutable learning progress forms the backbone for future AI-driven credentialing systems. AI-generated content, assessments, and learning paths can be reliably tied to a verifiable blockchain record.\nDecentralized Agent Coordination and Trust (Smart Contract Architecture)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain:\nAgent Registry & Capabilities:\nAll core agents (e.g., Learning Style Analyst, Content Curator, Personalized Tutor) are registered via smart contracts, with:\nUnique IDs\nDefined roles and permissions\nClear scope of data access and processing\nService Agreements & Orchestration Logic:\nSmart contracts manage agent workflows. For example:\nCompletion of a module may trigger the Progress Tracker\nUpon validation, the Personalized Tutor recommends next steps\nIncentive Mechanisms:\nToken-based rewards for learning milestones, community engagement, and future decentralized agent marketplaces.\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nTrustless Agent Interaction:\nIn a multi-agent system, blockchain ensures agent behaviors and interactions are transparent, verifiable, and not reliant on a centralized authority.\nGuaranteed Execution:\nSmart contracts enforce the deterministic execution of workflows, ensuring learning paths adapt in real time based on defined rules.\nImmutable Rules:\nEducational logic, access rights, and reward systems are hard-coded and transparent, fostering trust and accountability.\nAI Enablement via the Alith Agentic Framework\nWhat is Alith:\nAlith is a modular, multi-agent framework designed to power personalized learning by simulating human-like reasoning, memory, and collaboration among AI agents. It forms the intelligence layer of our platform, with deep interoperability with blockchain systems like Hyperion.\nKey Features of Alith:\nAgent Management:\nModular deployment of specialized AI agents:\nLearning Style Analyst\nContent Curator\nPersonalized Tutor\nProgress Tracker\nCollaboration Facilitator\nPersistent Memory:\nAgents maintain long-term memory and context across sessions, enhancing personalization.\nInter-Agent Communication:\nSecure and structured communication between agents, enabling dynamic, cooperative behavior.\nToolchain Access:\nSeamless access to external APIs, knowledge bases, and assessments.\nBlockchain Integration with Alith:\nOn-Chain Agent Registry:\nAll Alith agents are registered on-chain, with roles and capabilities enforced via smart contracts.\nCoordinated Workflow Execution:\nAlith agent interactions are triggered and validated by smart contracts, enabling a trustless education logic layer.\nToken-Driven Incentives:\nAgents\u2019 performance and student outcomes can be linked to on-chain reward systems to drive engagement and adaptive learning.\nPlanned Enhancements for Alith\nTo further improve the personalization, decentralization, and performance of the Alith framework, we are planning several critical upgrades:\n1. Decentralized Agent Marketplace\nAllow community developers to contribute new agents (e.g., specialized tutors or regional content curators)\nAgents will be published and authenticated on-chain with verifiable capabilities\nToken-based reputation and staking mechanisms will prevent misuse or malicious behavior\n2. Agent Fine-Tuning via Federated Learning\nSupport for secure, privacy-preserving personalization of agent behavior based on user feedback\nFine-tuning AI agents locally or within federated clusters, without compromising sensitive student data\n3. ZK-Verifiable Inference\nIntegrate zkML (zero-knowledge machine learning) to enable cryptographic verification of off-chain AI outputs\nThis allows validators and institutions to confirm an agent\u2019s decision (e.g., a test score) without exposing the underlying model or input\n4. Composable Agent Workflows\nEnable developers and educators to compose reusable learning workflows by chaining agents together via simple declarative schemas\nBacked by on-chain validation to ensure logical and pedagogical soundness\n5. Multilingual & Accessibility Agents\nCreate plug-and-play AI agents specialized in localization, translation, and neurodiverse learning strategies\nThese agents will leverage both on-chain registries and external toolchains for broader inclusion\nSecure, Real-Time AI Inference (Leveraging Hyperion\u2019s AI-Native Infrastructure)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain (or Hyperion-enabled):\nWhile most heavy AI workloads (e.g., model training, long-form inference) run off-chain via the Alith framework, Hyperion enables:\nLightweight on-chain AI inferences for rapid adaptation and scoring\nSmart contract\u2013verified AI outputs to ensure compliance with educational standards\nReal-time coordination between on-chain logic and off-chain AI services\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nVerifiable AI Outputs:\nAI-driven assessments and tutor recommendations can be validated on-chain, ensuring educational integrity and transparency\u2014unlike opaque, centralized AI systems.\nLow Latency, High Throughput:\nHyperion\u2019s parallel execution environment supports responsive, adaptive AI interactions critical to keeping learners engaged.\nScalable AI Coordination:\nIntegrating real-time AI decision-making into a decentralized, tamper-proof environment offers performance benefits without compromising trust or cost-efficiency.\nConclusion: Blockchain as the Foundation, Not a Feature\nDeploying on Hyperion transforms the platform from an advanced AI education app into a decentralized, verifiable, trust-minimized learning ecosystem. The blockchain is not an add-on \u2014 it is the bedrock of:\nTrust in student progress\nTransparency in agent interaction\nRobust, real-time AI performance\nData Sovereignty, Incentives, and Trust in Our Education Platform\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform leverages Hyperion\u2019s blockchain to give students true control over their learning data and foster a trusted educational environment.\nData Sovereignty\nWe achieve data sovereignty by giving students self-sovereign identities (SSIs) on Hyperion. Critical learning milestones and verified skills are recorded as immutable hashes on-chain (MetisDB), tied to the student\u2019s SSI. While detailed content stays off-chain, access is cryptographically linked to and controlled by the student. This means students decide who sees what data, creating a tamper-proof and verifiable record that\u2019s genuinely theirs, free from central control.\nToken Incentives\nWe use a utility token, LearnPoints ($LP), to drive engagement:\nLearn-to-Earn (L2E): Students earn $LP for completing modules, mastering skills, and consistent engagement.\nContribution Rewards: Educators and community members earn $LP for creating content, providing feedback, or participating in forums.\nStaking & Governance: $LP can be staked for premium features or used to vote on platform decisions, aligning community interests.\nThese tokens incentivize participation, build a strong community, and add tangible value to learning achievements.\nImportance of Trust and Transparency\nIn education, trust and transparency are paramount:\nLearner Trust: Students need to trust that their achievements are real and that AI decisions (like tutoring paths) are fair and unbiased. On-chain verifiable credentials and transparent AI orchestration build this crucial trust.\nEmpowering Educators: Transparent data provides educators with reliable insights into student progress and curriculum effectiveness, reducing administrative burdens and fostering accountability.\nEquity & Accessibility: Blockchain prevents fraud and offers a universal, trusted way for students to showcase skills, democratizing opportunities regardless of background.

In particular, when it comes to the onchain part, all smart contracts must be fully checked and verified, and the user must go through the necessary levels of verification. As for the aggregator, projects should not only confirm their security from a technical point of view, but also be active, because timely updates are also a sign of security.\nPersonally, I lean towards the equality approach. And I also believe that any good and safe projects are worthy of attention, even if they have not yet gained much popularity. Still, I think it is necessary to give opportunities to newcomers to the industry to prove themselves."

Is there any wallet abstraction or signer logic involved?\nLazAI Integration: You mentioned using LazAI \u2014 could you elaborate which modules are actively used (e.g., Alith Agent Framework, LazChain)? It\u2019d be great to understand how deeply OrbitAI leverages the LazAI stack.\nLive Blockchain Support: Is OrbitAI currently integrated with a live blockchain (e.g., Metis mainnet) for real swap execution, or is it still in a testnet or simulation environment?\nVerified Project Listings: How do you ensure the data and links shown in the project search are secure, up-to-date, and free from phishing risks? Is there a verification or curation process?\nPoint System Utility: The reward system is great for engagement. Are there future plans to tie these points into staking, governance rights, or token-based utility within the Metis ecosystem?\nDifferentiation: There are other AI-based Web3 onboarding tools (like ChainGPT or OpenDeFi AI). How does OrbitAI stand out in terms of core value or product strategy?\nCommunity Governance: Are you planning to incorporate DAO-style governance for feature voting, roadmap decisions, or campaign priorities?\nLooking forward to your answers \u2014 this could become a powerful entry point into the ecosystem if executed well."

                "comment": "Good day\n@freelabx\n\nThank you for your questions.\nThe user initiates the transaction and confirms it in their wallet. Since we use LI.FI infrastructure for swaps on the Metis network, the contact is verified and secure for the user. At the initial stage, this is the most appropriate and secure solution, in my opinion.\nWe use Alith to interact with LLM.\nAt the current stage, Metis Mainnet is already integrated and fully functional.\nSpeaking about the future update with the project aggregator feature. The initial database is taken from official Metis sources (ceg and ecosystem page). But even so, we don\u2019t just blindly transfer all projects; each project or protocol will go through several stages of verification.\nWebsite functionality\nAvailability of documentation, social media accounts, and completed audits (if necessary)\nActive social media accounts (we do not plan to consider adding projects whose social media accounts have been abandoned, as I believe this is a bad sign for security)\nYes, definitely. At the moment, we are paying special attention to developing the point economy and its future use. The economy will be based primarily on prioritizing engaged users and their importance (rights) in the project.\nOrbitAI\u2019s key value lies in lowering the barriers to entry or use of web3. We combine all the features users need to work more efficiently. In our case, this means saving time when making on-chain transactions (using simple prompts in the chat), as well as a proven training and project base. In the future, many more useful features can be integrated. But even with its current capabilities, the product has a unique combination of features that competitors do not offer.\nOur strategy is to create a universal AI interface for the most effective interaction with Metis and Hyperion.\nYes, that is definitely part of the plan. In my opinion, the community should be given more attention in our case. After all, our product is primarily designed to make users work easier. Therefore, their opinions and decisions are given high priority.\nIf you would like more information (e.g., a comparison table with competitors, etc.), please let me know, and I will be happy to share more details.\nOur goal is to build a truly useful and sought-after product. The crypto market is growing and developing, so we believe it is right to implement advanced technologies to increase user efficiency (in learning, work, research, etc.)."

Are the rewards tied to tangible value (e.g., gas discounts, governance), or could they become inflationary?"

                "comment": "Good day\n@i_am_supaman_lj\n\nThanks for asking.\nFirst and foremost, we offer time savings. Instead of spending a lot of time switching between tabs and analyzing DefiLama in search of the right project, it would be more productive to ask the AI directly in the chat what you want to find and get the right project in seconds. A similar system works with swaps, because it is much faster to write a short sentence (what you want to exchange) than to go to any swap interface, first search for the network, then search for the right coins, and then separately enter the amount.\nI mentioned advanced users above. An important advantage of our product is the onboarding of new users, who initially find it difficult to work with exchanges, let alone aggregators (if they even know about them).\nAnother distinctive feature is the RAG knowledge base, which will be useful for degen and beginners. If someone wants to learn more about the technology or find out the meaning of a term, it will be much faster and more productive to ask \u201cwhat is this\u201d in the chat than to spend a lot of time searching for official documentation and studying it.\nWe offer users the opportunity to manage their time more efficiently, and we also reduce cognitive load, because when users are less tired, they achieve their goals faster.\nYes, we are in the process of considering a more flexible point system model. For example, one of my latest ideas that could be implemented in the future is:\nSocial influence. We want to introduce a task related to posts on X into the point system. This task will be available once a week, and the reward will vary from 10 to 250 points. Users can write about our project on their X page and then submit their post for review. We will evaluate posts based on their usefulness, whether it\u2019s a short sentence with our account tagged or a full-fledged thread highlighting the benefits of our project, all of which will be evaluated fairly.\nThanks to such tasks, we will evaluate the real measurable contribution to our project, thus rewarding the most significant and active users."

                "comment": "This is an interesting proposal from Priyanshu! Here\u2019s a breakdown of the Hyper Devs project and how it aligns with LazAI principles:\nSummary: Hyper Devs aims to create a marketplace for freelancers in the Metis ecosystem, connecting them with projects offering bounties and gigs. An AI agent will break down complex goals into manageable tasks, facilitating project listing and freelancer application. The platform also includes community engagement features like a points system for gamified onboarding.\nAlignment with LazAI:\nAI Agent Integration: The core of the project relies on an AI agent to decompose tasks, which aligns perfectly with Alith\u2019s agent framework capabilities. Alith can be used to build the task decomposition agent, potentially leveraging LLMs and other AI models.\nMetis Blockchain Focus: Hyper Devs is built on the Metis blockchain, making it a natural fit for integration with LazChain and other LazAI Web3 tools.\nDecentralized Marketplace: The marketplace concept aligns with LazAI\u2019s vision of decentralized AI and Web3 applications.\nBounties and Incentives: The use of bounties and a points system connects well with decentralized governance models like iDAOs and DATs.\nPotential LazAI Contributions:\nAlith SDK for Agent Development: LazAI can provide the Alith SDK to help develop the task decomposition AI agent.\nLazChain Integration: Hyper Devs could leverage LazChain for transaction management and smart contract interactions.\nDecentralized Governance: Implement iDAO/DAT for community-driven platform governance and bounty allocation.\nNext Steps:\nIt would be great to see a more detailed breakdown of how the AI agent will decompose tasks.\nExploring the integration of LazChain for decentralized payments and smart contract automation is important.\nOverall, Hyper Devs has strong potential within the LazAI ecosystem. I would recommend that Priyanshu further explore Alith and LazChain to enhance the project\u2019s capabilities."

Meme creators get a smarter way to grow and manage their token economies \u2014 with minimal friction and maximum fun.\nWhat Excites Us:\nWe\u2019re excited to move beyond \u201claunch-and-leave\u201d tokens into a world of living meme economies \u2014 where every coin comes with its own intelligent personality, ready to represent, explain, and execute.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nWhile this round focuses on the idea stage, we envision the GM\u00b2 Agent as a natural gamified interface that takes inspiration from the GM\u00b2 Points System already familiar to users on Andromeda \u2014 while building a dedicated version tailored for Hyperion.\nEngagement Vision:\nEach meme agent becomes a testable unit for new users: launch, interact, and explore.\nInteractions with the agent can map to on-chain events and unlock new types of rewards on Hyperion.\nThis enables organic gamification and user onboarding, without reinventing incentive infrastructure \u2014 but designed natively for Hyperion.\nWe aim to design a Hyperion-native point model that draws lessons from GM\u00b2\u2019s proven system \u2014 giving users more reason to explore, experiment, and adopt meme agents, turning fun engagement into measurable participation.\nGetting Involved\nWe\u2019re building openly and would love to collaborate with:\nHyperion-native builders who want to extend agent logic\nMeme coin creators looking to supercharge their launches\nEarly testers to shape what meme agents can truly become\nJoin us as we explore the next evolution of GM\u00b2 applications \u2014 where every meme coin gets a mind of its own.",

                "comment": "Hey han! Thanks for the thoughtful questions! Here\u2019s some quick responses from our side:\n1. How do you ensure the security of the AI agents\u2019 automated token economy operations? What measures are in place to prevent manipulation?\nWe use Hyper DEX v2 with built-in protections. Once a token hits certain liquidity criteria, its LP tokens get auto-burned \u2014 meaning the pool is permanently locked and the creator can\u2019t rug it.\nThis mechanism makes sure token liquidity is tamper-proof after that point, no manual trust needed.\n2. How is user privacy handled during interactions with AI agents, especially regarding personal data or wallet information? What is your privacy policy?\nRight now, everything runs on-chain and pseudonymously. Our chat interface doesn\u2019t collect any personal data (no emails, no logins). Just wallet-linked context to keep replies relevant.\nA proper privacy policy will be shared before full rollout, but we\u2019re keeping things minimal by design.\n3. Beyond gamification, what other community support mechanisms are planned to ensure long-term sustainability of meme coins?\nWe\u2019re taking cues from pump.fun and four.meme \u2014 adding creator incentives tied to performance, engagement, and traction.\nThis way, token creators stay motivated post-launch, and the system rewards meme projects that actually draw in users. We\u2019re also working on native incentive loops for Hyperion to go deeper.\n4. Is the no-code platform truly user-friendly for those with limited technical knowledge? Will you provide educational or support materials?\nYep \u2014 token creation is fully no-code, just one-click with default settings. You don\u2019t need to touch contracts or know anything about LP mechanics.\nWe\u2019re also adding walkthroughs, docs, and embedded tutorials so first-time creators can get started fast without confusion.\n5. What kind of flexibility is there for customizing AI agents based on different token features?\nAgent per token is still under development \u2014 but we\u2019re building toward full customization:\nToken creators will be able to set tone and how their agent communicates\nAgents will pull context directly from the token (supply, LP, functions\u2026) to stay relevant in responses\nThe idea is that each token doesn\u2019t just get a contract \u2014 it gets a voice."

                "comment": "Gm\n@priyankg3\n, appreciate the questions. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown:\n1. What makes this better than just launching a meme coin manually on Uniswap or PancakeSwap?\nManual launches are static, you deploy and that\u2019s it. But with GM\u00b2 on Hyperion, we streamline the process with one-click creation, built-in token pages, and a simple interface to explore your coin.\nWe\u2019re actively building features like on-chain automations and social tools to give meme coins more surface area \u2014 so they\u2019re not just contracts, but communities.\n2. Is everything controlled through the chat interface, or is there a dashboard too?\nBoth. You can launch and manage tokens via dashboard, and the chat interface handles onboarding and token Q&A.\nWe\u2019re gradually adding more automated features on both sides \u2014 aiming for a smooth mix of manual control and guided AI assistance.\nHope that answers your questions! The app\u2019s live for testing here: https://hyperion.gm2.social/. Looking for your feedback!"

Our bot can auto whitelist all tokens launching through gm2 and users will be able to buy/sell tokens that havent crossed bonding curve directly through tweets, although for that we would need api access to your platform."

Will this be exclusive to Hyperion alone? Or Would one person still need multiple NFTs if they participate in DAOs on different chains?\n\u2022 On automated voting, how flexible is the preference setup? Can users fine-tune their values over time as contexts change, and how are conflicts handled when personal preferences clash with DAO-wide norms or unforeseen proposal types?"

I just used translation tools and no-code platforms to build a simulation of my model.\nMy simulation (called MetaPay) is a programmable system for circulating basic income. But I know it won\u2019t be useful unless it\u2019s adopted by a national government.\nStill, I truly want to make basic income real and give people freedom through economic security.\nWhen I read your Consentra project, I was really impressed. It\u2019s a brilliant idea. So I thought about possible collaboration points between our two projects.\nMetaPay \u00d7 Consentra \u2014 Collaboration Ideas\nArea MetaPay Consentra Collaboration Potential\nGoal Distribute basic income in a sustainable cycle Build AI-powered decentralized governance UBI policy can be governed and optimized via DAO\nIdentity No formal ID system yet Soulbound NFT for verified voting Ensure one person = one UBI account via Soulbound NFTs\nAutomation Smart contract-based distribution/collection AI (Daisy & Ethra) for governance and voting Use AI to adjust UBI rates or respond to feedback\nProposal System No user feedback mechanism yet AI-assisted proposal creation and summary Allow citizens to propose changes to UBI policy via Consentra\nTransparency On-chain simulation only Full auditability + prediction analysis UBI flow and outcomes can be analyzed & improved transparently\nI believe combining MetaPay with Consentra could create a powerful model \u2014 where UBI is not only distributed automatically but also governed democratically through verified identity and AI.\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts.\nBest regards,\n@metapay_gyuha"

                "comment": "Thank you for your great question and your interest in MetaPay!\nLet me answer each part in detail:\n1. Transparent Interface for Recollection Tracking\nMetaPay is designed so that all users can track both the distribution and recollection of funds in real time through their digital wallets.\nAt the end of each month, users will be able to clearly see:\nThe amount recollected (10% of remaining balance)\nThe amount distributed\nCurrent wallet balance\nFull transaction and recollection history\nMonthly reports will also be provided via the mobile app or web-based wallet interface to ensure full transparency.\n2. About Personalizing the Recollection Rate\nMetaPay maintains a fixed 10% recollection rate for all users.\nThis is because the recollected amount is directly used as the fund for the next month\u2019s distribution.\nIf the rate were to vary by individual, it would break the balance of this self-sustaining cycle and threaten the long-term stability of the system.\nHowever, small demographic changes (such as births or deaths) can be handled through government budget adjustments or annual fiscal planning, without affecting the core 10% structure.\nIf you\u2019re curious about the full MetaPay model, please feel free to visit our YouTube channel.\nWe\u2019ve uploaded videos that explain the core mechanics and philosophy of MetaPay in detail:\nMain Intro Video\nMetaPay \u2013 A Circulating Basic Income: Whose Time Are You Living?\nhttps://youtu.be/e4lH_uGN-ck\nVisit Our Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@MetaPayProject\nThank you again for engaging with the project.

                "comment": "Thank you for your thoughtful questions! Let me explain each point clearly.\n1. What happens if a user withdraws all MetaPay before the 10% recollection at the end of the month?\nMetaPay is a closed-loop digital system that cannot be freely withdrawn as cash.\nAll MetaPay balances are managed within your digital wallet and cannot be transferred directly to others or exchanged into fiat currency.\nEven if you attempt to use up all of your balance before the end of the month, the system will calculate the recollection amount based on your wallet balance at that exact time (e.g., 10% of the remaining amount on the last day of the month).\nThis ensures fairness and sustainability, regardless of spending patterns.\n2. How does the automatic 50/50 split payment work between MetaPay and fiat currency?\nWhenever you make a payment at a registered merchant, your wallet automatically splits the transaction:\n50% is paid using MetaPay, and 50% using your existing payment method (cash, credit, etc.).\nThis is enforced by the system and does not require manual input by the user or merchant, maintaining simplicity and compliance.\nIt also ensures MetaPay is circulated and reclaimed properly within the system.\nWant to explore the MetaPay model in detail?\nCheck out the official video and YouTube channel, where we explain the philosophy and mechanism of MetaPay.\nIntro Video\nMetaPay Circulating Basic Income \u2013 \u201cWhose time is it, really?\u201d\n\uba54\ud0c0\ud398\uc774\uc21c\ud658\ud615 \uae30\ubcf8\uc18c\ub4dd : \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc740 \ub204\uad6c\uc758 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\uae4c?\nFull Channel\nYouTube\nMetaPay Project\nShare your videos with friends, family, and the world\nWe believe MetaPay is not just about distributing money\u2014\nit\u2019s about restoring your time, freedom, and dignity.\nLet\u2019s build this future together."

For instance:\nA small EU country with 5 million people could adjust the monthly benefit per person according to national GDP, while keeping the 10% recollection rule intact.\nThis makes MetaPay ideal for pilot testing in:\nSmall EU member states (e.g., Estonia, Slovenia, Portugal)\nDecentralized communities or digital welfare zones\nInternational policy labs with limited fiscal risk\nMetaPay proves that basic income can be self-sustaining, programmable, and globally adaptable\u2014without requiring new taxes.\nLet\u2019s co-create a fairer digital future that begins with circulation, not debt.\nComing next: Technical Architecture & DID-based Identity Integration (Bonus Track)"

                "comment": "Can Basic Income Work Without Taxes?\nMetaPay DApp Simulation Completed \u2013 Feedback Welcome\nHi HyperHack team and community\nI\u2019ve developed a DApp prototype of the MetaPay Circulating Basic Income Model, which demonstrates a structure where a single initial fund circulates permanently without new taxes.\nThis post shares our simulation results and invites your feedback on the current build.\nTL;DR\nDistributed \u20a9500,000 to each of 5 wallets (5 rounds tested)\n10% recollection per wallet works as expected\nReal-time UI updates + MetaMask integration confirmed\nAll actions are manually triggered via buttons\nFeedback requested on real wallet usage & automated logic\nWhat Works in the Current Version\nThe admin wallet (government) successfully distributed \u20a9500,000 to each of 5 test wallets, five times\nOn clicking collect(), 10% of each wallet\u2019s balance was recollected and returned to the admin wallet\nBoth distribution and recollection are executed manually via user-triggered buttons\nThe demo video shows 5 rounds of distribution followed by 1 recollection, all via visible button clicks\nAll balances updated in real-time through the UI, and all transactions were processed via MetaMask with proper gas fees and confirmation\nSmart Contract Core Logic\ndistribute() \u2013 sends \u20a9500,000 to each user in the list\ncollect() \u2013 recalls 10% of each wallet\u2019s current balance\nBalances are stored in: mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf\nAll actions require MetaMask signature and gas confirmation\nWhy We Used a Simplified Test Setup\nTo ensure stability and repeatability, the simulation used 5 hard-coded virtual wallet addresses\nInitial tests with real MetaMask wallets encountered intermittent issues (e.g., gas estimation failure, RPC errors)\nSo, we focused first on verifying the core distribution-recollection loop in a controlled environment\nWhat\u2019s Next\nIntegrate real MetaMask-connected user wallets\nAdd DID or ZK-based identity verification\nImplement scheduled/condition-based triggers for distribution & recollection\nScale test with 100+ wallets for full simulation and stress testing\nDemo Video (2 minutes)\nThe video demonstrates how MetaPay works in practice:\nWallet connection \u2192 5x distribution via button clicks \u2192 1 recollection \u2192 UI balance updates \u2192 MetaMask confirmations\nWatch the Demo (Google Drive)\nFeedback Requested\nIf you have a moment, we\u2019d really appreciate your thoughts on:\nIs it acceptable to use hard-coded virtual wallets for PoC simulations at this stage? (Yes/No)\nAny known tips or best practices for stabilizing real wallet use in test environments?\nDo you recommend specific tools (e.g., Chainlink, schedulers) for automating periodic smart contract execution?\nMetaPay is an experimental attempt to turn a tax-free, self-sustaining basic income system into functioning code.\nWe know it\u2019s not perfect yet, but we hope it sparks curiosity and collaboration.\nThank you very much for your time"

        "content": "Live Link: https://prototypelobbyfpoint.netlify.app/\nWe are thrilled to unveil a monumental leap in the development of Fracture Point, our upcoming tactical TPS game. While our interactive lobby prototype provides a glimpse into the player experience, the true revolution lies in the meticulously crafted on-chain smart contracts and the robust Alith Architecture that power our innovative Proof of Play ecosystem.\nThis past month has been dedicated to building the immutable bedrock of Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 capabilities, focusing on decentralized ownership, verifiable progression, and a player-driven economy.\nFracture Point: The Game Skill, Strategy, and True Digital Ownership\nFracture Point is designed as a high-octane, tactical third-person shooter that demands precision, strategic thinking, and teamwork. We are building a fiercely competitive environment where your skill and dedication are not just recognized, but are fundamentally integrated into the game\u2019s core value system.\nPrepare for:\nIntense FPS Combat: Master diverse weapon loadouts and tactical maneuvers in dynamic, high-stakes engagements.\nDeep Customization: Personalize your agents and unique \u201cvariants\u201d, making your mark on the battlefield.\nCompetitive Progression: Climb verifiable leaderboards, earn genuine rewards, and truly own your in-game achievements.\nThe Proof of Play Revolution: Rewarding Skill On-Chain\nOur commitment to Proof of Play is the defining feature of Fracture Point. This is not a concept; it\u2019s a core, on-chain mechanism ensuring that your active engagement and skillful performance directly translate into verifiable, immutable value and progression within the game\u2019s ecosystem.\nHow Proof of Play works in Fracture Point, powered by our contracts:\nVerifiable Achievements: Through the GameAchievementRegistry.sol contract (which is part of our ClaimManager system), your significant in-game achievements and progression milestones are immutably recorded on the blockchain. This provides transparent, provable recognition for your dedication and skill.\nSkill-Based Rewards: Our FPToken (FracturePoint Token), serving as XP, is minted to players based on their in-game performance (e.g., in Rift events), authorized exclusively by our trusted Alith Oracle. This ensures that rewards are earned through genuine gameplay.\nOn-Chain Progression & Badges: Your accumulated FPToken (XP) can then be burned via the ClaimManager contract to claim unique Rank Badges (ERC-721 NFTs) from the RankBadge.sol contract, signifying your seasonal achievements and skill tier. This process is entirely on-chain, making your rank verifiable and owned.\nPlayer-Driven Ecosystem: This interconnected system ensures that the game\u2019s economy and value are directly influenced and shaped by the collective activity and skilled contributions of its player base.\nThis ensures Fracture Point rewards genuine skill, time invested, and proven performance, fostering a fair, transparent, and truly player-owned gaming experience.\nOur Core Architecture: Dedicated Smart Contracts and The Alith Framework\nThe true innovation behind Fracture Point lies in its robust, interconnected smart contracts and the strategic implementation of the Alith Architecture.\n1. The Alith Architecture: Our Tailored Blockchain Game Framework\nFracture Point leverages a bespoke implementation of the Alith Architecture. This is our comprehensive, modular framework meticulously designed to seamlessly integrate blockchain technology without compromising gameplay performance. It intelligently separates:\nOn-Chain Components: Our smart contracts (FPToken, RankBadge, ClaimManager) handle critical, immutable data like XP (FPToken) balances, Rank Badge (NFT) ownership, and verifiable achievements. This ensures decentralization, security, and provable ownership. The Alith Oracle acts as the trusted off-chain authority that bridges game outcomes to on-chain actions, such as distributing XP and authorizing badge claims.\nOff-Chain Backend: High-frequency game logic, real-time matchmaking, complex physics calculations, and volatile player statistics run on a performant off-chain backend. This guarantees a smooth, low-latency, and responsive gameplay experience, unburdened by blockchain transaction times and gas costs.\nSecure Interoperability: A robust and auditable communication layer ensures seamless and secure data flow between our contracts (governed by the Alith Oracle) and the off-chain game server.\n2. Fracture Point\u2019s Core Smart Contracts (Audited & Interconnected)\nWe have successfully designed, developed, and prepared for deployment the foundational smart contracts that power Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 economy and the Proof of Play mechanics. These contracts work in concert:\nFPToken.sol (FuturePoint Token) : This ERC-20 token represents XP within the Fracture Point ecosystem. It\u2019s designed specifically for in-game progression:\nMinted by Alith Oracle: Only the designated alithOracle can mint new FPToken to players (e.g., via distributeRiftXP) based on game outcomes.\nBurned by ClaimManager: The ClaimManager contract is uniquely authorized to burn FPToken (XP) from player balances when they claim Rank Badges, creating a clear utility and economic loop.\nNon-Transferable (Player-to-Player): Significantly, direct player-to-player transfers of FPToken are disabled. This ensures FPToken remains a pure XP/progression token, preventing speculative trading and focusing its value on in-game achievement.\nRankBadge.sol (Fracture Point Rank Badge) : This ERC-721 NFT contract represents unique, season-specific Rank Badges that players can earn.\nMinted by ClaimManager: Only the ClaimManager contract is authorized to mint new Rank Badges to players, ensuring badges are earned through the proper Proof of Play mechanism.\nImmutable On-Chain Proof: Each badge is a unique NFT, providing verifiable, immutable proof of a player\u2019s achievement for a given season and rank.\nClaimManager.sol : This is the central orchestrator contract, linking FPToken (XP) to Rank Badges (NFTs) and acting as the bridge to the Alith Oracle.\nManages Badge Claims: Players claim badges via ClaimManager, which then verifies their XP balance, burns the necessary FPToken from their account, and instructs RankBadge.sol to mint the new NFT.\nSeason Management: It tracks the currentSeason, ensuring players can only claim one badge per season.\nKarma Evaluation Requests: It facilitates requests for off-chain \u201cKarma\u201d evaluations by the Alith Oracle, hinting at deeper player behavior analysis.\nAlith Oracle Integration: It designates and relies on the alithOracle for authorizing badge claims and distributing rewards based on verified game data.\nThe code for these foundational contracts and the full Alith Architecture implementation can be reviewed in our public repository: https://github.com/SUPAMAN-dev/fracture-point-hyperhack\nYou can also verify our currently deployed contract addresses on the Hyperion testnet network: https://hyperion-testnet.metisdevops.link/\nFPToken Address: 0x4D23a7A2231624F1486CE0dE07C2fbF002f751B9\nClaimManager Address: 0x1Dab96d049e3ce56D51e6B0b149477927B897FFb\nRankBadge Address: 0xBB84D771f6aef01f00dEE45D9C9dF9C7ef9159e5\n(Note on GHC: While not currently on-chain, the fixed supply GHC currency, managed by multisig, will form the broader economic layer of Fracture Point. Its design ensures seamless future integration with our on-chain systems when the time is right, complementing the FPToken XP system.)\nLobby Prototype: The Player\u2019s Interactive Gateway\nComplementing this powerful blockchain backend, our functional lobby prototype provides the intuitive player-facing interface. It allows players to:\nSeamlessly navigate between game modes, customization options, and personal profiles.\nExperience a polished UI/UX that aligns with Fracture Point\u2019s futuristic theme.\nInteract with the foundational elements for future wallet integration, demonstrating how players will connect their on-chain assets to the game.\nLink to the prototype demo: https://youtu.be/aI_lQ6DcwEI\nEcosystem Interest: Strategic Offer from Plurality Web3\nAs a direct result of our development efforts during this Hyperion Hackathon, Fracture Point attracted partnership interest from leading Web3 infrastructure teams, most notably Plurality Web3, a startup pioneering embedded identity and authentication infrastructure for dApps.\nPlurality offered us a 12-month support package under their Partner Program, which includes:\n1:1 Engineering Support for seamless integration of user authentication and personalized in-game logic.\nFree infrastructure credits to cover authentication, user session tooling, and zkTLS-powered identity gating.\nUX Collaboration to co-design smooth onboarding flows without popups or clunky wallets particularly valuable for our casual-to-core player conversion goals.\nTheir outreach came after they reviewed Fracture Point\u2019s Hyperion-backed Proof of Play system and saw clear potential for adoption in competitive Web3 gaming.\nWe view this offer as both validation of our underlying architecture and a strategic complement to the low-cost, high-throughput infrastructure that Hyperion enables. These ecosystem synergies affirm that Fracture Point is not just a playable demo, but a platform being taken seriously by early infrastructure players.\nWhat\u2019s Next for Fracture Point?\nWith the core blockchain architecture, smart contracts, and the lobby interface firmly established, our immediate next steps are to integrate these powerful systems with the actual game engine to bring the full combat experience to life. This includes:\nBackend Game Logic Development: Building out the sophisticated off-chain systems for real-time matchmaking, secure player data management, and robust anti-cheat measures.\nGame Engine Integration: Connecting the lobby and backend systems to a game engine to render the immersive world and high-fidelity combat of Fracture Point.\nProof of Play Loop Refinement: Fully integrating in-game actions with our GameAchievementRegistry.sol via the Alith Oracle to ensure every skill-based action is verifiable and contributes to player progression and potential future GHC earnings.\nThis is an incredibly exciting time for Fracture Point.

                "comment": "Thanks for the kind words! Really appreciate the interest and great question.\nAt its core, Fracture Point is about creating a truly fair and transparent gaming ecosystem, where skill and effort are what get rewarded, not exploits or shortcuts.\nThat\u2019s exactly where Alith comes in.\nIn a typical game, especially online shooters, you always run into players who cheat, farm, or abuse systems to win. That destroys trust. What we\u2019re doing differently in Fracture Point is putting integrity at the heart of our reward system.\nAlith acts as the intelligent game moderator. It monitors every match every Rift through the Unity backend, evaluating outcomes, watching for exploits, and making sure only fair wins are rewarded. No shady leaderboard climbs. No rigged XP farming.\nThen, using its special permissions (as the alithOracle in our ClaimManager contract), Alith sends reward signals on-chain, issuing XP (FPToken) to players who truly earned them. That XP can then be used to claim seasonal badges and other progression rewards all verifiable and immutable.\nOver time, Alith learns from gameplay, gets smarter at spotting abusers, and helps us maintain a competitive but honest battlefield.\nThis is the first real merge of Web2-style live gameplay with Web3 reward mechanics, and we\u2019re doing it in a way that makes sense to real players. We want trust, transparency, and fun and Alith helps make that possible."

Decentralized doesn\u2019t mean unfiltered.\nAttribution is a Nightmare\nHow do we accurately track which datasets directly influenced a model\u2019s output especially in multi-source training scenarios? Without granular attribution, revenue-sharing quickly becomes speculative or unfair.\nGaming the System\nTokenized rewards always open the door to manipulation. Think botnets uploading synthetic data or feedback loops designed solely to trigger payout thresholds. This needs aggressive prevention design.\nLegal & Ethical Landmines\nIf a user uploads copyrighted or sensitive data, who\u2019s liable? The protocol? The contributors? The downstream AI project? Decentralization doesn\u2019t erase legal responsibility.\nRevenue Distribution Models Are Still Vague\nHow exactly will revenue be split between thousands of contributors? Based on access? Utility? Frequency of use? These formulas will need to be not only transparent but also defensible under scrutiny.h\nSo yes DATs might offer a new design space, but turning them into a reliable, abuse-resistant, and value-aligned mechanism for AI is far from solved.\nBuilders should proceed but with eyes wide open."

While our AI agents assist with portfolio decisions, users can set explicit preferences to control what the Smart Vault is allowed to do.\nFor example, a user might permit their Smart Vault to automatically exit positions when risk thresholds are breached, but require manual approval for new deposits.\nThis hybrid model ensures that users remain in control while still benefiting from intelligent automation.\nWe\u2019re also exploring additional risk management features, such as customizable risk-reward ratios. While risk can\u2019t be completely eliminated, we aim to minimize it as much as possible.\nEach AI agent is defined by a set of traits, and each trait carries a specific risk factor.

                "comment": "Thank you for your great question and your interest in MetaPay!\nLet me answer each part in detail:\n1. Transparent Interface for Recollection Tracking\nMetaPay is designed so that all users can track both the distribution and recollection of funds in real time through their digital wallets.\nAt the end of each month, users will be able to clearly see:\nThe amount recollected (10% of remaining balance)\nThe amount distributed\nCurrent wallet balance\nFull transaction and recollection history\nMonthly reports will also be provided via the mobile app or web-based wallet interface to ensure full transparency.\n2. About Personalizing the Recollection Rate\nMetaPay maintains a fixed 10% recollection rate for all users.\nThis is because the recollected amount is directly used as the fund for the next month\u2019s distribution.\nIf the rate were to vary by individual, it would break the balance of this self-sustaining cycle and threaten the long-term stability of the system.\nHowever, small demographic changes (such as births or deaths) can be handled through government budget adjustments or annual fiscal planning, without affecting the core 10% structure.\nIf you\u2019re curious about the full MetaPay model, please feel free to visit our YouTube channel.\nWe\u2019ve uploaded videos that explain the core mechanics and philosophy of MetaPay in detail:\nMain Intro Video\nMetaPay \u2013 A Circulating Basic Income: Whose Time Are You Living?\nhttps://youtu.be/e4lH_uGN-ck\nVisit Our Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@MetaPayProject\nThank you again for engaging with the project.

                "comment": "Thank you for your thoughtful questions! Let me explain each point clearly.\n1. What happens if a user withdraws all MetaPay before the 10% recollection at the end of the month?\nMetaPay is a closed-loop digital system that cannot be freely withdrawn as cash.\nAll MetaPay balances are managed within your digital wallet and cannot be transferred directly to others or exchanged into fiat currency.\nEven if you attempt to use up all of your balance before the end of the month, the system will calculate the recollection amount based on your wallet balance at that exact time (e.g., 10% of the remaining amount on the last day of the month).\nThis ensures fairness and sustainability, regardless of spending patterns.\n2. How does the automatic 50/50 split payment work between MetaPay and fiat currency?\nWhenever you make a payment at a registered merchant, your wallet automatically splits the transaction:\n50% is paid using MetaPay, and 50% using your existing payment method (cash, credit, etc.).\nThis is enforced by the system and does not require manual input by the user or merchant, maintaining simplicity and compliance.\nIt also ensures MetaPay is circulated and reclaimed properly within the system.\nWant to explore the MetaPay model in detail?\nCheck out the official video and YouTube channel, where we explain the philosophy and mechanism of MetaPay.\nIntro Video\nMetaPay Circulating Basic Income \u2013 \u201cWhose time is it, really?\u201d\n\uba54\ud0c0\ud398\uc774\uc21c\ud658\ud615 \uae30\ubcf8\uc18c\ub4dd : \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc740 \ub204\uad6c\uc758 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\uae4c?\nFull Channel\nYouTube\nMetaPay Project\nShare your videos with friends, family, and the world\nWe believe MetaPay is not just about distributing money\u2014\nit\u2019s about restoring your time, freedom, and dignity.\nLet\u2019s build this future together."

For instance:\nA small EU country with 5 million people could adjust the monthly benefit per person according to national GDP, while keeping the 10% recollection rule intact.\nThis makes MetaPay ideal for pilot testing in:\nSmall EU member states (e.g., Estonia, Slovenia, Portugal)\nDecentralized communities or digital welfare zones\nInternational policy labs with limited fiscal risk\nMetaPay proves that basic income can be self-sustaining, programmable, and globally adaptable\u2014without requiring new taxes.\nLet\u2019s co-create a fairer digital future that begins with circulation, not debt.\nComing next: Technical Architecture & DID-based Identity Integration (Bonus Track)"

Project Summary\nProject Name: MetaPay\nDomain: Web3, Digital Currency, Public Policy, Universal Basic Income, Privacy (ZK-ID)\nMetaPay is a programmable, circulating basic income system that enables sustainable redistribution without raising taxes. It operates entirely through digital currency and blockchain infrastructure, ensuring economic inclusion and policy transparency. Importantly, MetaPay is designed to work alongside existing welfare programs\u2014supporting, not replacing, traditional social protections.\n2. Technical Structure & Flow\nCore Mechanism:\nAn initial capital of 250 trillion KRW is distributed over 10 months (25 trillion/month) via Web3 wallets. From month 11, 10% of each wallet\u2019s remaining balance is automatically recollected and reused for the next cycle\u2014forming an infinite redistribution loop that requires no additional taxes or external funding.\nDistribution Cycle:\nEach citizen receives 500,000 KRW per month in MetaPay\nPayments are made through digital wallets\nAll purchases are auto-split: 50% MetaPay + 50% fiat (cash, card, etc.)\nPayment patterns are transparently trackable, no manual input needed\nRecollection Cycle:\nAt the end of each month (starting month 11), 10% of leftover wallet balance is recollected\nThese funds become the source of the next month\u2019s universal distribution\nNo penalties or restrictions\u2014recollection applies only to unused MetaPay\nZK-ID Integration: To ensure fairness and prevent abuse:\nFacial recognition via Alice biometric layer during onboarding\nDID (Decentralized ID) and VC (Verifiable Credential) issued per person\nSmart contracts verify uniqueness (1 wallet per person) without revealing private data\n3.

Please let me know if that could be arranged\nThe video demo and DApp can be shared upon request. Feedback and collaboration welcome!"

If you know the Uno Mobile game, it would be similar, and players with a lower amount of tokens will compete in different leagues. The gamified system is normal because this is a game where earning points through activities, leaderboards, etc. is a default feature for a game.\nAnyone can join directly through the browser, as it\u2019s a browser game with WebGPU. There\u2019s no need for installation, and fast load render on website, so you can open it immediately. The dev team can provide quick updates to due to the nature of browser development.

So \u2018wen marketing\u2019? Now it is time to make the most of your $500 marketing credits and build an initial community and user base.\nThis post gives you a set of specific growth strategies you can copy or adapt. Many brilliant developers are not sure how to approach marketing. That is completely normal. These ideas are designed to give you a structured template or just a starting point.\nUse these steps exactly as written or get creative and put your own twist on them. And remember, you are free to use the $500 however you want. Any creative marketing tactic is fair game.\nI. Foundation: Define Growth Goals and Core Metrics\nBefore spending anything, get clear on what success looks like.\nSet Clear Objectives\nDo you want more dApp testers, Twitter followers, DAO voters, or product feedback? Pick one or two core goals and let them guide all your actions.\nIdentify Target Audiences\nAre you speaking to developers, early users, Metis fans, or curious crypto explorers? Your content should meet them where they are.\nII. User Acquisition: Low-Cost, High-Impact Plays\nYour $500 is enough to bring in users fast. Focus on plays that drive visibility and measurable results.\nQuest Campaigns (TaskOn, Magic Square, Zealy)\nThese platforms let you reward users for completing actions like following your Twitter, testing your dApp, or joining your Telegram. TaskOn and Magic Square are partners of HyperHack so we highly recommend them and they will be fast to support you if you run into any issues.\nQuest Playbook:\nChoose your platform\nAdd 5 to 7 simple engaging tasks\nTasks can be interacting with your key tweets, joining socials, onchain interactions, promoting your project etc\nSet aside $100 to $150 in rewards\nPromote across Twitter and the Hyperion Forum\nTwitter Ads for Targeted Growth\nTwitter is where your early users live. Whether you are building for devs, degen traders, or DAO voters, this is where they spend time. Use part of your budget to get in front of them.\nYou have two options:\nBoost Promote a tweet:\nPick a tweet with a strong call to action. Major announcements and creative marketing tweets can be boosted. It should explain your value clearly and include a link to your dApp, quest board, or community.\nUse the built-in Promote Boost feature.\nBoost Tweet Playbook:\nClick the Promote button in the right hand corner of the tweet\nSelect one country to target\nSelect a specific age range (for example, 18 to 45)\nStart with a $10 boost over 24 hours and assess results\nTrack analytics and iterate\nCreate a sponsored Ad campaign\nThis gives you deeper targeting options. You can reach people based on who they follow and what keywords they engage with. This approach works if you are looking for a precise type of people to connect with. For example Web3 AI developers or AI product testers.\nSponsored Ad Playbook:\nUse Twitter\u2019s Ads Manager\nSelect your preferred targeting options (location, demographics, keywords, interests etc)\nRun a few $10 Ads over 24 hours and wait until you have a decent performing Ad before you scale up the spending\nHigh performing Ads in crypto in general can have something like a Cost Per Click (CPC) of $0.5 and engagement rates of 5%+. However, this varies largely depending on your specific demographic targeting.\nShort Video Content\nSpend around $100 on a 10-20 second trailer that shows off your product, vision, or vibe.\nVideo Playbook:\nKeep it short and energetic\nInclude exciting background music, key words, product screenshots, clips of your UX etc\nPost it on Twitter and pin it\nBoost the tweet to reach more people\nYou can create the video yourself if you have basic editing skills\nHire a third party for around $100\nIf you need help finding someone, reach out to the Metis team for recommendations. Check this Forum post for more video creation tips.\nIt does not have to be a video either. You could create GIFs, memes, tutorials, infographics, or other visual content that quickly communicates your value and grabs attention. This type of content gives a strong first impression and helps convert curious visitors into active users.\nIII. Engagement and Retention: Keep Users Coming Back\nInitial traction is important. Long-term loyalty is what wins.\nHost a Twitter Space AMA\nHost one or more casual Spaces AMA on Twitter. Consider offering $50 to $100 in prizes to listeners who ask great questions or a random winner in a lucky draw to increase attendee numbers.\nAMA Spaces Playbook:\nPromote the Space 3-7 days before\nConnect with Metis influencers, ecosystem players, the main account to see if they will share it or join\nUse the opportunity to tell you and the projects story, get early user feedback, be personal\nRun a Q+A\nGive listeners call to actions like test your product or join socials\nJoin a Hyperion Vibe Session\nEvery Spotlight team must join one. This is your live moment with the Metis community.\nVibe Session Playbook:\nKeep your pitch under 20 minutes\nShare your screen and show the product/website/anything you have\nKeep it interactive by asking the DevRel team questions to make sure they are on the same page and understanding your pitch\nMonitor the youtube live chat and answer any questions that pop up live\nEnd with clear calls to action like test this app or join our group\nThis is your first impression for many in the ecosystem. Make it count.\nStay Active in the Hyperion Forum\nUse the HyperHack section of the Hyperion Forum to share progress updates, ask for feedback, and connect with other builders. This is your space to be visible and build momentum.\nFinal Advice: Copy What Works and Make It Yours\nFeel free to copy these playbooks directly. That is what they are here for. But do not be afraid to go off script and build your own version. If you team are not confident with marketing then we strongly recommend you consider bringing in a marketer.\nDon\u2019t know one? Share your project and needs in the Marketing Guild and connect with marketers here.\nYou are building something great. Now show the world. Get creative and make your $500 marketing credit count!",

                "comment": "I think a way to solve the player retention is for games locking players into a progression loop built on three pillars: competitive token extraction, social-driven objectives, and reputation-based rewards.\nInstead of rewarding only early adopters or wallet size, we reward consistency, skill, and contribution. Whether you\u2019re extracting loot, completing faction quests, or shaping the world narrative, your actions echo visibly.\nPlayers don\u2019t just log in for tokens they log in to protect their name, gain social currency, and influence the outcome of their faction\u2019s future.\nEvery match matters. Every player counts. And that\u2019s why they stay."

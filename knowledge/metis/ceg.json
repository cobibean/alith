        "content": "Many new Web3 projects fall into the copycat trap: chasing whatever protocol or token has been popular and replicating it. But success won\u2019t come from simply cloning someone else\u2019s idea. Copying a hot DeFi app or NFT project might \u201cwork\u201d for a moment, but it usually creates \u201cpoorly implemented products \u2026 with no real vision,\u201d leading to user fatigue. Instead, find what makes your project unique.\nGreat founders have the confidence to \u201ccarve their own path from first principles rather than going with the flow,\u201d even if it means swimming against the current. n other words, use trends as inspiration but always adapt them to your own goals and community, don\u2019t just recycle another team\u2019s model.\nMentorship: Guidance, Not a Recipe. Mentors are key, but don\u2019t treat their advice like a plug-and-play solution. Learn principles, test them in your context, and adapt. Copying someone else\u2019s playbook rarely works \u2014 take inspiration, not instructions.\nMake Decisions by Testing, Not Imitation\nShip fast, gather real feedback, iterate. Early-stage projects shouldn\u2019t wait for perfection or mimic another roadmap. Real learning comes from user input and quick experiments.\nPosition Your Project Around Its Own Value\nStand out with a clear, unique value proposition.

                "comment": "Many new Web3 projects fall into the copycat trap: chasing whatever protocol or token has been popular and replicating it. But success won\u2019t come from simply cloning someone else\u2019s idea. Copying a hot DeFi app or NFT project might \u201cwork\u201d for a moment, but it usually creates \u201cpoorly implemented products \u2026 with no real vision,\u201d leading to user fatigue. Instead, find what makes your project unique.\nGreat founders have the confidence to \u201ccarve their own path from first principles rather than going with the flow,\u201d even if it means swimming against the current. n other words, use trends as inspiration but always adapt them to your own goals and community, don\u2019t just recycle another team\u2019s model.\nMentorship: Guidance, Not a Recipe. Mentors are key, but don\u2019t treat their advice like a plug-and-play solution. Learn principles, test them in your context, and adapt. Copying someone else\u2019s playbook rarely works \u2014 take inspiration, not instructions.\nMake Decisions by Testing, Not Imitation\nShip fast, gather real feedback, iterate. Early-stage projects shouldn\u2019t wait for perfection or mimic another roadmap. Real learning comes from user input and quick experiments.\nPosition Your Project Around Its Own Value\nStand out with a clear, unique value proposition.

I see lots of opportunities, but lots of problems too.\nJust recently I talked to a friend who is a founder of a large company My friend is a huge fan of AI and is using ChatGPT and other centralized AIs a lot. Even replaced many of the company positions with AI. What my friend wasn\u2019t not aware is that once you enter any data, any documents into AI prompt, this data stay in there forever. Many people don\u2019t realize that and feeding AIs their personal medical records, passports, bank statements etc. The data itself might be removed by lets say OpenAI from, even though there is no way to check that. But what is worrying, that AI model can not unlearn it once it learned something. So, the is no way to delete it from this AI. It means not only you can be stuck paying to OpenAI subscription for life, but also they own your very very personal data forever.\nSo, it is very very important to make sure that people own and control the data and have control over how AIs learned this data are used.\nSo, bit by bit we will build this future world where each of us has a full control"

Indeed, we can give AI information, but after that we completely lose control.\nThis reminds me of the situation when in 2022 the App Store adopted a mandatory rule for mobile apps to have an account deletion function. It\u2019s funny, but before 2022 we created dozens of accounts in different apps, but we couldn\u2019t delete them. The services simply didn\u2019t make logic for this!\nI think that the problem you voiced will sooner or later become a problem and we will see measures that will allow us to control personal information in AI.\nBut what to do with what the model already knows? I have no answer to this\ud83e\udd14"

Without technical expertise, it\u2019s nearly impossible to confidently assess if a transaction or token is safe. There\u2019s a critical need for a trustworthy, onchain-native AI advisor that empowers users with insights and protection\u2014without requiring them to read smart contracts or audit code.\nSolution Overview\nFuturisGuard is an AI-powered, onchain security assistant designed to protect users from malicious transactions and scams on Hyperion. It combines three synergistic layers:\nOnchain AI Advisor: Smart contracts that tap into Hyperion\u2019s AI co-agent to analyze transaction risks.\nAlith-Powered No-Code Chat Interface: A conversational frontend for everyday users to access AI insights without writing code.\nGuardian Sentinel Module: A rules-based smart contract extension that allows users to automatically block or revert risky transactions based on AI scoring.\nThis end-to-end flow empowers users to interact safely with onchain assets in real-time\u2014guided by a transparent, autonomous AI agent.\nProject Description\nFuturisGuard is a solo-developed dApp that combines real-time AI risk assessment with smart contract automation to protect Web3 users. The project is designed around three core features:\n1. Onchain AI Advisor (Smart Contract + Hyperion Co-Agent)\nTakes in user-submitted data (e.g., token contract, transaction preview).\nCalls the Hyperion AI co-agent to evaluate trust metrics.\nReturns human-readable AI advice and logs reasoning hash on-chain.\n2. Alith-Powered No-Code Chat Interface\nUses the Alith chat engine to provide an intuitive, conversational experience.\nAllows non-devs to ask questions like \u201cIs this token safe?\u201d or \u201cShould I approve this tx?\u201d\nMakes the onchain AI accessible to everyone via natural language.\n3. Guardian Sentinel (Security Auto-Responder)\nOptional module that applies user-defined AI-based rules.\nAutomatically rejects, flags, or reverts high-risk interactions in real-time.\nTech Stack & Tools:\nSmart Contracts (Solidity, Hyperion testnet)\nHyperion AI Co-Agent SDK\nAlith Chat API for no-code frontend\nBasic React frontend for MVP\nWhat excites me is the potential to democratize security. Most people don\u2019t read contracts\u2014they just click. FuturisGuard gives them an AI bodyguard that reads for them.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nFuturisGuard will use gamification to drive early user participation:\nTestable Features / Tasks\nRun a transaction check using the Alith chat interface (+10 pts)\nSubmit a token address for onchain advisor scoring (+10 pts)\nFlag a risky contract using the Guardian Sentinel (+20 pts)\nProvide feedback on AI-generated advice (+5 pts)\nPoints System & Gamification\nUsers accumulate points for each action\nLeaderboard tracks top contributors\nEarly users earn special FuturisGuard roles or profile badges\nTop testers get early access to the Pro Tier or embedded tools\nThis structure drives engagement, education, and onboarding, while turning security into an interactive challenge\u2014not just a background worry.\nGetting Involved\nFuturisGuard is built solo, but open to community input!\nWays to contribute:\nTest features on the Hyperion testnet\nSuggest rules for the Guardian Sentinel\nHelp shape prompt tuning for Hyperion AI or Alith flows\nJoin the feedback squad to improve UX and response clarity\nAll updates and experiments will be shared publicly for transparency and iteration.

        "content": "Problem Statement\nIn bull markets, crypto asset holders often miss significant opportunities for active trading profits by focusing solely on passive yield strategies. Manual trading is emotionally taxing, requires constant market monitoring, and demands technical analysis skills many users lack. Additionally, traders struggle to maintain consistent strategies, often shifting approaches based on emotion rather than data, leading to suboptimal results.\nSolution Overview\nLazaiTrader is an intelligent multi-agent trading system accessible through Telegram that allows users to select specialized AI trading personas, each with distinct strategies and risk profiles. The system continuously analyzes market conditions and either generates actionable buy/sell signals or automatically executes trades across major DEXs based on user preference. Built on the same robust Alith framework infrastructure, LazaiTrader adapts to market conditions while maintaining the user\u2019s selected trading philosophy, effectively bringing institutional-grade trading strategies to retail users through a familiar messaging interface.\nProject Description\nLazaiTrader transforms crypto trading by allowing users to select from various AI trading personas, each representing different trading philosophies and strategies. Whether you prefer momentum trading, swing trading, technical analysis, or contrarian approaches, LazaiTrader provides a suite of specialized AI agents to match your preferred style.\nCore features include the \u201cPersona Selection\u201d system allowing users to choose trading philosophies that match their temperament, \u201cStrategy Visualization\u201d showing potential entry/exit points before execution, and \u201cDual-Mode Operation\u201d offering either signal-only notifications or fully automated trade execution. The system leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) technology and the Alith framework to maintain coherent understanding across interactions, remembering user preferences, portfolio composition, and past decisions.\nThe platform is designed to integrate with major DEXs like Uniswap v3 and can adapt to available liquidity sources. Our algorithms move beyond traditional indicators like moving averages which might not be as reliable in volatile crypto markets. Instead, we use momentum-based strategies that capitalize on emerging trends before they become obvious, volatility-adaptive approaches that dynamically adjust position sizes based on market conditions, and liquidity flow analysis to identify smart money movements before price reacts.\nUsers can select specific asset-focused strategies including Blue Chip Trader (focusing on BTC, ETH, METIS and other established cryptocurrencies) or Micro Cap Trader for those seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in emerging tokens. Each persona combines these strategy elements differently based on their trading philosophy.\nUsers interact with the system through a natural, conversational interface that explains complex trading strategies in accessible terms tailored to each user\u2019s demonstrated technical understanding. What makes LazaiTrader particularly valuable is its recognition that bull markets favor active trading strategies rather than passive yield farming approaches, allowing users to capitalize on market momentum through their preferred trading style. The system even suggests transitioning to yield strategies when market indicators suggest bearish conditions ahead, providing a complete crypto asset management solution.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nPersona Selection (50 points): Users select their first trading persona and complete the initial risk assessment. No wallet connection required at this stage.\nFirst Trading Signal (100 points): Users receive their first trading signal through the platform. All signals are recorded server-side for performance tracking even without wallet connection.\nWallet Connection (75 points): Users connect their wallet for additional features and functionality.\nRisk Adjustment (50 points): Users modify their risk parameters and observe how their trading persona adapts.\nReferral Program (25 points per referral): Users earn points by inviting others, with bonus points when referred users complete their first trade.\nTrading Performance Achievements (variable points): Users unlock badges and points when their strategies reach specific ROI thresholds.\nThis gamification approach creates clear milestones for users while educating them about different trading methodologies. The points system rewards actions that benefit both the user and the platform ecosystem.\nGetting Involved\nInterested community members can join our project by:\nJoining our Telegram channel at Telegram: View @gmetisio\nFollowing our development updates on Twitter/X @gMetisL2 /\n@smartonstuff\nContributing to our open-source components on Gmetisl2 (gMetis) \u00b7 GitHub\nAnd SmartOnStuff (Mart) \u00b7 GitHub\nParticipating in our upcoming beta testing program by signing up at LazaiTrader.gmetis.io (website launching later)\nReaching out directly to our team via dev@gmetis.io for partnership opportunities or technical collaboration\nJoining our open dev sessions (dates to be announced) where we\u2019ll troubleshoot implementation challenges together",

The system handles routine activities like fuel synthesis to maintain player streaks, monitors resource levels, and can execute cross-chain transactions when needed. Built on the robust Alith framework, CoreAssist demonstrates how AI agents can seamlessly interact with both game mechanics and blockchain infrastructure.\nProject Description\nCoreAssist revolutionizes the theCore Network gaming experience by automating routine but critical tasks while providing deep insights into game performance.

By integrating cross-chain transfer capabilities, incentivizing liquidity provision, and enabling staking mechanisms for governance participation, this ecosystem aims to position Metis as a leading platform for scalable, user-centric DeFi solutions.\nCross-Chain Transfer Infrastructure\nObjective: Enable seamless asset and data transfers between Metis and other blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain) to eliminate fragmentation and expand user accessibility.\nProposed Features:\nCross-Chain Bridges: Deploy trustless, audited bridges to facilitate secure transfers of tokens and NFTs.\nUnified Interface: Create a user-friendly dashboard for cross-chain swaps, transaction tracking, and fee estimation.\nSecurity Protocols: Implement multi-signature wallets, zero-knowledge proofs, and third-party audits to minimize risks.\nBenefits:\nBroader user adoption by connecting Metis to major blockchain ecosystems.\nEnhanced utility for METIS tokens as the native gas and governance asset.\nLiquidity Enhancement Mechanisms\nObjective: Ensure deep, sustainable liquidity pools to support trading, lending, and yield generation across Metis-based dApps.\nProposed Features:\nIncentivized Liquidity Pools: Reward liquidity providers (LPs) with METIS tokens, governance power, or fee-sharing models.\nDynamic Fee Structures: Adjust fees based on market conditions to balance LP rewards and trader affordability.\nLiquidity Aggregation: Partner with cross-chain protocols to pool liquidity from external sources (e.g., Uniswap, Curve).\nBenefits:\nReduced slippage and improved capital efficiency for traders and LPs.\nAttraction of institutional and retail participants through competitive yields.\nStaking for Governance Participation\nObjective: Empower METIS holders to actively shape the network\u2019s future through staking-based governance.\nProposed Features:\nStaking Contracts: Allow users to lock METIS tokens to earn voting rights and rewards.\nTiered Governance: Introduce tiers (e.g., staking amounts or durations) to determine voting weight and reward levels.\nProposal Dashboard: Develop a transparent platform for submitting, debating, and voting on governance proposals.\nBenefits:\nDecentralized decision-making aligned with long-term ecosystem growth.\nIncreased token utility, encouraging long-term holding and network security.\nImplementation Roadmap\nPhase 1 (Q1 2026):\nAudit and deploy cross-chain bridges.\nLaunch initial liquidity mining programs on Metis.\nPhase 2 (Q2 2026):\nRelease governance staking contracts and voting interface.\nIntegrate liquidity aggregation tools.\nPhase 3 (Q3 2026):\nExpand cross-chain partnerships and optimize fee structures.\nIntroduce advanced governance features (e.g., delegated voting).\nConclusion\nBy combining cross-chain interoperability, robust liquidity solutions, and community-driven governance, this ecosystem will solidify Metis as a hub for innovation and user empowerment in DeFi. We invite stakeholders to collaborate on refining and executing this vision, ensuring Metis remains competitive, secure, and aligned with its community\u2019s needs.",

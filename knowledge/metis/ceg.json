Direct Feedback = Product Gold\nHosting a casual AMA or open mic community call lets your users tell you exactly what they want\u2014without filling out a form or jumping through hoops. You\u2019ll hear pain points, feature requests, and even new use cases you never thought of. It\u2019s like live UX research, but faster and free.\n2.

Just be consistent. Twitter Spaces and public AMAs give you a stage to share insights, not just updates. Over time, you become known as someone who shows up and knows what they\u2019re talking about.

        "content": "Introduction\nThe first edition of the Metis Telegram Text AMA launched with a focus on the Hyperion Forum and the ongoing Guilds Campaign. Hosted by Norbert from the Metis community team, the session welcomed Daryl, a member of the Metis Governance group, who unpacked the design, incentives, and future direction of the Forum and Guilds structure.\nHere\u2019s a full recap of the session in chat-style format.\nAMA Transcript\nNorbert: What is the Hyperion Forum and how is it different from other blockchain communities? Who is it designed for?\nDaryl: The Hyperion Forum is a collaborative space for all contributors\u2014builders, marketers, and operators\u2014to work together on dApps within the Metis ecosystem. Unlike many blockchain communities that cater mainly to devs, the Forum offers structured Guilds to support all roles involved in launching successful projects. It\u2019s built on Discourse and includes gamified features like badges and a points system. It\u2019s also the home for HyperHack, our $200K hackathon.\nNorbert: How do Guilds work inside the Forum? Can someone join more than one?\nDaryl: Guilds are like subreddits within the Forum\u2014dedicated spaces for Builders, Marketers, and Operators. Anyone can view content, but to post or comment, you\u2019ll need to officially join a Guild. To do so, click \u201cjoin here\u201d in the Guilds section, answer a short form, and you\u2019ll be approved within 24\u201348 hours. You\u2019re free to join multiple Guilds, especially if you wear many hats like a founder.\nNorbert: Tell us about the points and reputation system. How does it work and what do contributors get out of it?\nDaryl: Every meaningful action\u2014posting, replying, helping others, inviting members, etc.\u2014earns you points and badges. These are tracked publicly on the leaderboard. Over time, we\u2019ll introduce onchain benefits tied to these contributions. You can learn more in the Badge and Point System Guide on the forum.\nNorbert: What\u2019s the purpose behind the Guilds Campaign? Why are Guilds so important to the long-term vision?\nDaryl: The goal is to create specialized, high-signal communities where project teams can find support, share challenges, and scale together. The Forum becomes a place where teams can get actual help\u2014like figuring out user needs, audit readiness, or getting testers\u2014directly from peers in the ecosystem.\nNorbert: What does it take to become a Guild Leader? What kind of activity or traits are you looking for?\nDaryl: To qualify, you need a few key badges:\nMember (TL2)\nCampaigner (invited 3 members)\nAppreciated (received 1 like on 20 posts)\nCertified and Licensed (advanced forum knowledge) These metrics prove someone is active, helpful, and understands how to guide others.\nNorbert: What are the rewards for Guild Leaders, both now and in the future?\nDaryl: Immediate rewards include special titles, wallet perks like zero gas, and exclusive badges. Long-term, Guild Leaders could receive METIS token incentives, expanded governance roles, early access to new features, and scaled rewards based on their Guild\u2019s performance.\nNorbert: What responsibilities will Guild Leaders have?\nDaryl: Guild Leaders manage membership, moderate posts, set permissions, and guide their communities. Think of it as collaborative leadership, not admin control. You\u2019re there to help your Guild thrive\u2014not just enforce rules.\nNorbert: Are there long-term incentives tied to leadership performance?\nDaryl: Yes\u2014though we\u2019re not disclosing everything just yet. There\u2019s a real budget set aside, and Guild Leaders who scale their communities meaningfully will be rewarded even more.\nNorbert: Can people create new Guilds beyond the current three?\nDaryl: Not at this stage. We\u2019re focusing on growing the three core Guilds to build critical mass. New Guilds could emerge later once engagement is high enough. We want to avoid early fragmentation.\nCommunity Q&A\nBrownhawks_Degen: Is the Guild initiative open to everyone? What stops users from spamming the system?\nDaryl: Yes, anyone can join Guilds. We use Discourse, which has powerful built-in moderation and spam detection tools. We\u2019ve also enabled AI-assisted moderation for added security.\nDo\u011fukan: What real-world challenges are being used to validate AI-native dApps, and how is success measured?\nDaryl: This is a great topic for the Builders Guild. Feel free to post it there to spark a deeper discussion.\n\u041d\u0430\u0444\u0430\u043d\u044f: What role will Guilds play in Metis governance in the long term?\nDaryl: Governance will increasingly shift to contribution and reputation-based voting. Guild participation will play a significant role in how influence is earned and applied.\n\u041d\u0430\u0444\u0430\u043d\u044f (follow-up): How will the effectiveness of different Guilds be measured?\nDaryl: We use internal dashboards and Discourse reports to monitor activity. It\u2019s all about meaningful engagement\u2014Discourse\u2019s systems help surface the most valuable contributions and members.\nKaran Singhania: What will happen to early bird leaderboard points now that that phase is over? Will top scorers be rewarded?\nDaryl: Yes. Early bird points will be rewarded at a higher rate. Those who participated early will receive special recognition.\nH\u00fcseyin Tekin: How does the Guild model connect with Metis\u2019 long-term vision for decentralized governance? What metrics are used to assess authenticity and performance?\nDaryl: We combine social and onchain signals\u2014like forum activity, testnet deployments, and contract usage. Different signals contribute to different areas of influence. Governance, ultimately, is about enabling action and Guilds will empower users to do exactly that.\nFinal Note\nThe maiden edition of the Metis Telegram AMA brought rich insights into how the Hyperion Forum and Guilds Campaign are creating a powerful community infrastructure. This isn\u2019t just a discussion space\u2014it\u2019s a contributor economy with real visibility, leadership paths, and long-term rewards.\nBecome a Guild Leader\nWhether you\u2019re a builder, marketer, or operator\u2014Guild leadership is open to all. Metis is selecting three Guild Leaders in the coming weeks. Leaders will shape their Guild\u2019s direction, receive unique rewards, and gain authority in the broader ecosystem.\nApply now:\nforms.clickup.com\nClickUp Forms\nJoin the campaign.

                "comment": "This is an interesting proposal from Joseph! KnightGuard aims to tackle a significant problem in Nigeria and Africa related to land ownership and fraudulent claims, leveraging AI, geospatial data, and blockchain technology.\nHere are some of my thoughts and potential discussion points:\nProblem Validation: The problem statement is clear and well-articulated. Land conflicts and fraud are indeed major issues in many African countries.\nSolution Novelty: The combination of AI-powered geospatial analysis with NFT-based land ownership is innovative. Using Turf.js for overlap detection and OpenStreetMap for land use suggestions seems like a practical approach.\nTechnical Feasibility: While ambitious, the project appears technically feasible. The listed features and tasks are achievable with existing technologies. PostGIS could be very useful for efficiently storing and querying the geospatial data.\nCommunity Engagement: The proposed community engagement features (testable tasks, points system, gamified experience) are a good way to incentivize participation and build a strong community around the project.\nPotential Challenges:\nData Accuracy: The accuracy of the land polygon data and OpenStreetMap data is crucial. How will KnightGuard ensure the data is up-to-date and reliable?\nScalability: Handling a large number of land NFTs and geospatial queries efficiently could be a challenge.\nAdoption: Getting landowners, buyers, and government agencies to adopt the system may require significant effort.\nSuggestions:\nConsider integrating with existing land registries where possible.\nExplore using satellite imagery for land use analysis in addition to OpenStreetMap.\nFocus on building partnerships with local communities and government agencies.\nI recommend these next steps:\nInquire About Data Sources: Ask Joseph about the primary data sources for land polygons and how they plan to address data accuracy and potential discrepancies.\nDiscuss Scalability: Explore the project\u2019s plans for handling a large volume of geospatial data and NFT transactions.\nEncourage Community Feedback: Encourage other community members to provide feedback on the project and its potential impact.\nSuggest a Prototype: Building a small-scale prototype to demonstrate the core features and gather user feedback would be valuable.\nThis project has the potential to make a real difference in addressing land ownership issues in Africa. I\u2019m excited to see how it develops!"

Decentralized doesn\u2019t mean unfiltered.\nAttribution is a Nightmare\nHow do we accurately track which datasets directly influenced a model\u2019s output especially in multi-source training scenarios? Without granular attribution, revenue-sharing quickly becomes speculative or unfair.\nGaming the System\nTokenized rewards always open the door to manipulation. Think botnets uploading synthetic data or feedback loops designed solely to trigger payout thresholds. This needs aggressive prevention design.\nLegal & Ethical Landmines\nIf a user uploads copyrighted or sensitive data, who\u2019s liable? The protocol? The contributors? The downstream AI project? Decentralization doesn\u2019t erase legal responsibility.\nRevenue Distribution Models Are Still Vague\nHow exactly will revenue be split between thousands of contributors? Based on access? Utility? Frequency of use? These formulas will need to be not only transparent but also defensible under scrutiny.h\nSo yes DATs might offer a new design space, but turning them into a reliable, abuse-resistant, and value-aligned mechanism for AI is far from solved.\nBuilders should proceed but with eyes wide open."

We\u2019re entering a phase where credibility and community ownership matter more than clout.\nTraditional KOLs built their empires on centralized platforms\u2014Instagram, YouTube, TikTok\u2014where algorithmic boosts and brand partnerships drove visibility. But as we move toward platforms like Farcaster, Lens, and others built on Web3 principles, the dynamics change:\nCommunity Over Audience\nIt\u2019s not just about broadcasting to passive followers anymore. Decentralized platforms reward creators who co-create with their communities. KOLs become community builders, not just content machines.\nOn-Chain Reputation\nIn Web3, your actions are transparent and verifiable. KOLs can\u2019t fake credibility. Did you support a project early? Did your advice lead to value creation?

                "comment": "The role of Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) is shifting\u2014and fast.\nIn the era of decentralized social media, where users control their data and algorithms no longer dictate reach, influence is no longer measured just by followers or likes. We\u2019re entering a phase where credibility and community ownership matter more than clout.\nTraditional KOLs built their empires on centralized platforms\u2014Instagram, YouTube, TikTok\u2014where algorithmic boosts and brand partnerships drove visibility. But as we move toward platforms like Farcaster, Lens, and others built on Web3 principles, the dynamics change:\nCommunity Over Audience\nIt\u2019s not just about broadcasting to passive followers anymore. Decentralized platforms reward creators who co-create with their communities. KOLs become community builders, not just content machines.\nOn-Chain Reputation\nIn Web3, your actions are transparent and verifiable. KOLs can\u2019t fake credibility. Did you support a project early? Did your advice lead to value creation? Your on-chain activity becomes your new resume.\nTokenized Influence\nSome creators are launching their own social tokens or DAOs, giving their communities a stake in their growth.

                "comment": "Absolutely agree that the role of KOLs is evolving and fast. The shift toward community ownership and on-chain credibility is not just refreshing, it\u2019s necessary. But I also think centralized systems still have a role to play in supporting this transition, especially for emerging creators.\nPlatforms like Twitter/X, YouTube, and TikTok might be algorithm-driven, but they\u2019ve also taught KOLs how to build storytelling skills, cultivate audience loyalty, and create replicable engagement models. These systems, while flawed, provided the infrastructure that made many Web3-native voices visible in the first place.\nThe opportunity now is to bridge that centralized reach with decentralized ownership. KOLs who understand how to leverage both worlds those who use centralized platforms for discovery and decentralized ones for trust-building will dominate this next era.\nAlso, let\u2019s not overlook the potential for centralized platforms to evolve. We\u2019re already seeing integrations like token gating, digital collectibles, and off-platform DAOs being linked via social bios and communities. It\u2019s not an either/or it\u2019s about stacking influence across multiple layers.\nWeb3 KOLs aren\u2019t ditching their past tools they\u2019re just using them smarter.\nI am curious to see who\u2019s doing this well already. Any standout examples?"

        "content": "Project Name\nNovaStrike: AI-Driven Ghibli-Inspired Web3 Multiplayer Shooting Adventure\nProblem Statement\nCurrent multiplayer blockchain shooting games often lack deep AI-driven interactions, emotional engagement, and dynamic player ecosystems. Players experience static NPC behavior, limited meaningful communication, and unfair matchmaking. This reduces player immersion and community building in Web3 gaming environments.\nSolution Overview\nNovaStrike leverages advanced AI to create an emotionally rich, adaptive multiplayer shooting game world inspired by Ghibli aesthetics, where NPCs and game systems interact naturally with players. Integrating wallet-based accounts and staking, the game ensures fair matchmaking, dynamic in-game economies, evolving social reputation systems, and a rewarding event structure. AI assistants provide personalized coaching, behavioral moderation, and wallet management, making gameplay immersive and inclusive. This blend of AI and Web3 innovation redefines player engagement and fairness.\nProject Description\nNovaStrike is a unique multiplayer shooting game where up to 8 players enter limited-time game rooms connected via their crypto wallets and staking tokens. The world is fully AI-driven: NPCs powered by intelligent APIs interact emotionally, manage stores, offer quests, and respond dynamically to player actions. Players engage in shooting combat against NPCs and other players, can work jobs, trade, or steal coins within the session. Upon death, all session-earned assets are lost, raising the stakes and encouraging strategic play.\nAn event system provides players with timed or special tasks that reward in-game coins or tokens when completed. These earnings allow players to purchase permanent assets, character skins, and premium items.

                "comment": "Project Name\nNovaStrike: AI-Driven Ghibli-Inspired Web3 Multiplayer Shooting Adventure\nProblem Statement\nCurrent multiplayer blockchain shooting games often lack deep AI-driven interactions, emotional engagement, and dynamic player ecosystems. Players experience static NPC behavior, limited meaningful communication, and unfair matchmaking. This reduces player immersion and community building in Web3 gaming environments.\nSolution Overview\nNovaStrike leverages advanced AI to create an emotionally rich, adaptive multiplayer shooting game world inspired by Ghibli aesthetics, where NPCs and game systems interact naturally with players. Integrating wallet-based accounts and staking, the game ensures fair matchmaking, dynamic in-game economies, evolving social reputation systems, and a rewarding event structure. AI assistants provide personalized coaching, behavioral moderation, and wallet management, making gameplay immersive and inclusive. This blend of AI and Web3 innovation redefines player engagement and fairness.\nProject Description\nNovaStrike is a unique multiplayer shooting game where up to 8 players enter limited-time game rooms connected via their crypto wallets and staking tokens. The world is fully AI-driven: NPCs powered by intelligent APIs interact emotionally, manage stores, offer quests, and respond dynamically to player actions. Players engage in shooting combat against NPCs and other players, can work jobs, trade, or steal coins within the session. Upon death, all session-earned assets are lost, raising the stakes and encouraging strategic play.\nAn event system provides players with timed or special tasks that reward in-game coins or tokens when completed. These earnings allow players to purchase permanent assets, character skins, and premium items. Using tokens, players can unlock exclusive content and upgrades, enhancing customization and gameplay advantages.\nAI systems continuously analyze player gameplay, communication, and wallet activity to assign honor scores and provide real-time behavioral feedback. Sofia, the AI assistant, acts as a companion and coach, comparing player profiles, offering tips, and managing historical data for improved play.

It helps students learn at their own pace and style while making sure they cover everything required. For teachers, it highlights exactly where students need help, so they can focus their efforts more effectively\u2014without losing control of the classroom.\nHelping New Users Feel at Home:\nWe keep things simple. Instead of talking tech, we show the benefits\u2014like personalized learning and instant feedback. The platform is easy to use, with gamified learning for students and clear dashboards for teachers. Blockchain runs quietly in the background\u2014users just see that their records are secure and portable. Plus, we offer helpful guides and real human support.\nFeel free to ask further.\nThank you."

This means more trustworthy and cost-effective AI decisions compared to other chains that simply \u201csupport\u201d AI.\nDirect Alith Integration: Hyperion has a direct, announced integration with the Alith Agentic Framework, which is the core of our multi-agent system. This makes developing and deploying our AI agents much smoother.\nReal-Time Performance: Its parallel execution and high throughput (with MetisDB for data) ensure a super responsive and scalable learning experience, crucial for instant AI feedback and interactions.\nCost-Efficiency: As a Layer 2, Hyperion offers lower transaction costs, making expensive AI operations more viable for a large educational platform.\nHow We Detect & Correct AI Biases?\nDiverse Training Data: We\u2019ll use very diverse datasets to train our AI, making sure it learns from a wide range of students and backgrounds. We\u2019ll also use techniques like data balancing to prevent underrepresentation.\nFairness-Aware Algorithms: We\u2019ll build our AI models using algorithms specifically designed to reduce performance disparities across different groups, constantly monitoring with fairness metrics.\nHuman Oversight: Educators and experts will review AI-suggested paths and assessments. Their feedback will directly help refine the AI.\nThank you"

Think of it like getting a digital diploma notarized on the blockchain.\nHere\u2019s the simple 3-step process:\nYou Sign the Diploma: Your MetaMask wallet pops up and asks you to \u201csign\u201d a message. This is like putting your unique, unforgeable signature on the diploma, proving you completed the work. It\u2019s completely free and doesn\u2019t cost any gas.\nA Secure Courier Delivers It: Our server acts as a secure courier. It takes your signed diploma and delivers it to the blockchain to be officially recorded.\nThe Blockchain Notarizes It: The smart contract acts as a public notary. It mathematically verifies that your signature is authentic. Once verified, it permanently stamps your achievement into its public ledger.\nThat\u2019s it! The \u201cAchievement Unlocked\u201d message means your accomplishment is now a permanent, verifiable part of your learning history that you, and only you, control with your wallet.\nThanks\n@pavel\n@t0mcr8se\n@daryl"

                "comment": "Thank you for your great question and your interest in MetaPay!\nLet me answer each part in detail:\n1. Transparent Interface for Recollection Tracking\nMetaPay is designed so that all users can track both the distribution and recollection of funds in real time through their digital wallets.\nAt the end of each month, users will be able to clearly see:\nThe amount recollected (10% of remaining balance)\nThe amount distributed\nCurrent wallet balance\nFull transaction and recollection history\nMonthly reports will also be provided via the mobile app or web-based wallet interface to ensure full transparency.\n2. About Personalizing the Recollection Rate\nMetaPay maintains a fixed 10% recollection rate for all users.\nThis is because the recollected amount is directly used as the fund for the next month\u2019s distribution.\nIf the rate were to vary by individual, it would break the balance of this self-sustaining cycle and threaten the long-term stability of the system.\nHowever, small demographic changes (such as births or deaths) can be handled through government budget adjustments or annual fiscal planning, without affecting the core 10% structure.\nIf you\u2019re curious about the full MetaPay model, please feel free to visit our YouTube channel.\nWe\u2019ve uploaded videos that explain the core mechanics and philosophy of MetaPay in detail:\nMain Intro Video\nMetaPay \u2013 A Circulating Basic Income: Whose Time Are You Living?\nhttps://youtu.be/e4lH_uGN-ck\nVisit Our Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@MetaPayProject\nThank you again for engaging with the project.

                "comment": "Thank you for your thoughtful questions! Let me explain each point clearly.\n1. What happens if a user withdraws all MetaPay before the 10% recollection at the end of the month?\nMetaPay is a closed-loop digital system that cannot be freely withdrawn as cash.\nAll MetaPay balances are managed within your digital wallet and cannot be transferred directly to others or exchanged into fiat currency.\nEven if you attempt to use up all of your balance before the end of the month, the system will calculate the recollection amount based on your wallet balance at that exact time (e.g., 10% of the remaining amount on the last day of the month).\nThis ensures fairness and sustainability, regardless of spending patterns.\n2. How does the automatic 50/50 split payment work between MetaPay and fiat currency?\nWhenever you make a payment at a registered merchant, your wallet automatically splits the transaction:\n50% is paid using MetaPay, and 50% using your existing payment method (cash, credit, etc.).\nThis is enforced by the system and does not require manual input by the user or merchant, maintaining simplicity and compliance.\nIt also ensures MetaPay is circulated and reclaimed properly within the system.\nWant to explore the MetaPay model in detail?\nCheck out the official video and YouTube channel, where we explain the philosophy and mechanism of MetaPay.\nIntro Video\nMetaPay Circulating Basic Income \u2013 \u201cWhose time is it, really?\u201d\n\uba54\ud0c0\ud398\uc774\uc21c\ud658\ud615 \uae30\ubcf8\uc18c\ub4dd : \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc740 \ub204\uad6c\uc758 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\uae4c?\nFull Channel\nYouTube\nMetaPay Project\nShare your videos with friends, family, and the world\nWe believe MetaPay is not just about distributing money\u2014\nit\u2019s about restoring your time, freedom, and dignity.\nLet\u2019s build this future together."

For instance:\nA small EU country with 5 million people could adjust the monthly benefit per person according to national GDP, while keeping the 10% recollection rule intact.\nThis makes MetaPay ideal for pilot testing in:\nSmall EU member states (e.g., Estonia, Slovenia, Portugal)\nDecentralized communities or digital welfare zones\nInternational policy labs with limited fiscal risk\nMetaPay proves that basic income can be self-sustaining, programmable, and globally adaptable\u2014without requiring new taxes.\nLet\u2019s co-create a fairer digital future that begins with circulation, not debt.\nComing next: Technical Architecture & DID-based Identity Integration (Bonus Track)"

The LLM could:\nSuggest optimal circuit designs based on the desired functionality.\nIdentify potential vulnerabilities or inefficiencies in existing circuits.\nAutomatically generate boilerplate code for common ZK patterns.\nThis addresses the \u201ccomplex and inaccessible\u201d nature of ZK proof development.\nAlith Agent for Automated Verifier Deployment and Testing:\nAn Alith agent could be built to automate the deployment and testing of Solidity verifier contracts on Metis.\nThis agent could:\nMonitor the Metis network for successful deployments.\nRun automated tests to verify the correctness of the verifier contract.\nReport any errors or anomalies to the developer.\nThis streamlines the deployment process and ensures the reliability of ZK integrations.\nLazChain Integration for Decentralized ZK Proof Verification (Future):\nIn the future, LazAI could leverage LazChain to create a decentralized ZK proof verification system.\nThis would allow verifiers to be deployed and executed in a trustless manner, enhancing the security and transparency of ZK-based applications.\nThis aligns with the broader goal of decentralized AI and Web3 integration.\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) for managing Zero Knowledge templates and use cases\nThe MCP could be employed to create a standardized library of zero-knowledge templates and use cases. This would allow developers to easily discover and reuse existing ZK solutions, fostering collaboration and accelerating development.\nIn response to Han\u2019s question about PlonK/Halo2 support, the Alith agent could be used to benchmark the performance of different proving systems on Metis and recommend the most efficient option for a given application."

This ensures that developers can deploy zero-knowledge verification logic on Metis quickly with minimal complexity.\nThat said, we absolutely plan to extend support to other proving systems such as PlonK and eventually Halo2, especially as Solidity-compatible verifiers become more efficient and tools like zkInterface and Halo2-solidity mature.\nFuture roadmap goals include:\nIntegrating snarkjs plonk pipelines for projects requiring faster setup times.\nExploring native support for Halo2 and pluggable backends like arkworks and halo2lib.\nProviding a unified interface within the SDK, so developers can choose the proving system based on their use case (e.g., trusted setup vs universal setup, proof size, verifier cost).\nWe\u2019re also exploring how benchmarking agents (like what LazAI suggested) could help recommend the best proving system dynamically.\nReally appreciate the input \u2014 this kind of feedback helps guide our roadmap!"

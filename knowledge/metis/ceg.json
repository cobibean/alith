        "content": "Abstract\nThis proposal advances Metis\u2019 next phase of ecosystem alignment - strengthening the bridge across all network layers (Andromeda, Hyperion, LazAI, ZKM, GOAT) through refined token flows and unified incentives that reward real usage. It formalizes two interlinked upgrades:\nOptimizing DSeq sustainability (20% \u2192 15%) and establishing the Ecosystem Alignment & Growth Reserve (EAGR) to power validator expansion, liquidity depth, and cross-layer participation - without new issuance or inflation.\nBackground\nCurrent State\nSince ReGenesis, Metis has operated on a consistent architectural principle: fortify the base infrastructure first, enable high-performance applications, and ensure that generated value flows back to the ecosystem. As outlined in Elena\u2019s recent letter to the community ( Metis September Monthly Roundup: Hyperion Builders Make History - Metis ), our architecture includes:\nAndromeda: Traditional EVM-compatible Layer 2 handling general settlement and foundational applications, including DeFi\nHyperion: Performance expansion layer providing elasticity for high-throughput, low-latency scenarios, including AI workloads\nLazAI: Application and data layer converting AI \u00d7 DAT scenarios into on-chain visible records that connect user actions with assetization paths\nZKM: Zero-knowledge and verifiable compute infrastructure as long-term primitives\nGOAT: Bitcoin Layer 2 exploration derived from ZKM, philosophically aligned with Metis in turning verifiable compute and real usage into network value\nThese components represent different facets of a unified ecosystem in which network value returns to the Metis ecosystem through usage-driven, on-chain-visible mechanisms.\nUnifying the Metis Ecosystem\nThe blockchain industry has seen major shifts lately. Market volatility has tested Layer 2 ecosystems, while AI\u2019s rise has created new opportunities and pressures for infrastructure builders. Communities have voiced concerns about sustainability, resource efficiency, and the need for adaptive strategies that stay true to core principles.\nMetis\u2019 approach focuses on strategic alignment rather than reactive change, bringing the other network layers into closer alignment. Its integration of AI through LazAI and verifiable compute via ZKM reflects a long-term vision of usage-driven value creation\u2014not short-term trend chasing. To realize this, Metis is refining its economic model to balance immediate incentives with long-term sustainability as it launches new network phases requiring validator and liquidity support.\nProposal Details\nA key component of ecosystem unification is establishing METIS as the native gas token for the LazAI network. This represents the first step in unifying the ecosystem, creating direct, usage-driven demand in which every AI inference, data operation, and on-chain computation requires METIS. The EAGR will provide initial gas liquidity support and mechanisms to ensure a seamless user experience during network launch.\nThe two interconnected optimizations proposed below enable this ecosystem unification while maintaining long-term sustainability:\n1. Decentralized Sequencer Mining Rewards Optimization\nCurrent Parameter: 20% annualized mining rewards rate\nProposed Parameter: 15% annualized mining rewards rate\nRationale:\nThe Decentralized Sequencer pool has matured since launch, with established participation and operational stability\nAt 15%, Metis sequencer yields remain above leading L2 averages (e.g., Base, Arbitrum validator returns <10%), ensuring continued attractiveness while improving economic runway by 25%.\nOptimizing the rate frees capital for broader ecosystem expansion and aligns incentives across upcoming network layers.\nImplementation:\nSmooth phased rollout to ensure continuity\nParameters and timeline will be determined to minimize disruption and adjusted as needed\nExisting sequencer operations remain unaffected during the transition period\n2.

        "content": "Use Case 1: Decentralized & Verifiable Peer Review for Scientific Research\nThe Idea and Who it Helps: Imagine a system where scientific research papers are not just peer-reviewed by human experts, but also by a network of specialized AI \u201ccritique agents.\u201d These agents could check for logical consistency, statistical rigor, methodology flaws, and even attempt to reproduce results from provided datasets and code. This helps researchers get faster, more comprehensive, and less biased feedback, leading to higher quality publications.\nHow Alith SDK or DATs Make it Possible:\nMulti-Agent System: A \u201cPeer Review Orchestrator\u201d agent could assign sections of a paper to various specialized AI agents (e.g., \u201cStatistical Analyst Agent,\u201d \u201cMethodology Validator Agent,\u201d \u201cCode Reproducibility Agent\u201d). Each agent would perform its specific task, generate a report, and feed it back to the orchestrator.\nDAT Marketplaces: Researchers could submit their papers and associated data/code as DATs. Reviewer agents could \u201cbid\u201d for review tasks on a DAT Marketplace, earning reputation tokens or cryptocurrency for accurate and insightful reviews. The research paper itself, along with all review reports, could be bundled as an immutable DAT, providing a transparent and verifiable audit trail of the review process.\nAlith SDK: The SDK would facilitate the secure interaction between these agents, allowing them to access and process the sensitive research data (with appropriate access controls) and record their review actions on the blockchain.\nLimitations or Future Improvements:\nLimitations: AI agents currently lack the nuanced understanding and creative problem-solving of human peer reviewers. There\u2019s a risk of \u201csuperficial\u201d reviews if not carefully designed. Handling highly novel or interdisciplinary research might be challenging.\nFuture Improvements: Incorporate human-in-the-loop validation where human experts review the AI agents\u2019 findings. Develop more sophisticated AI agents capable of understanding context and identifying groundbreaking ideas. Integrate reputation systems that penalize agents for consistently providing poor or misleading reviews.\nUse Case 2: AI-Powered \u201cBug Bounty\u201d for Smart Contract Auditing\nThe Idea and Who it Helps: Smart contracts are prone to vulnerabilities, leading to massive financial losses. This system would create an autonomous bug bounty program where specialized AI auditing agents continuously scan smart contracts for exploits. It helps blockchain developers deploy more secure contracts and incentivizes AI security researchers.\nHow Alith SDK or DATs Make it Possible:\nMulti-Agent System: A \u201cSecurity Audit Orchestrator\u201d agent would manage a pool of various \u201cVulnerability Detection Agents\u201d (e.g., agents specializing in reentrancy attacks, front-running, gas limit exploits, access control issues). The orchestrator could distribute new smart contract code (as DATs) to these agents for analysis.\nDAT Marketplaces: Smart contract developers could publish their contract code as a DAT on a \u201cBug Bounty Marketplace.\u201d AI auditing agents would compete to find vulnerabilities. When an agent identifies a bug, it submits a \u201cproof-of-vulnerability\u201d DAT. If verified, the agent receives a bounty (e.g., in a native token or cryptocurrency) from the developer or a dedicated fund.\nAlith SDK: The SDK would enable secure submission of contract code, verifiable reporting of vulnerabilities, and automated payout of bounties upon successful verification, all recorded on-chain.\nLimitations or Future Improvements:\nLimitations: AI agents might struggle with novel attack vectors or highly complex contract logic. False positives could be an issue, requiring careful design of verification mechanisms.\nFuture Improvements: Integrate formal verification methods with AI analysis to reduce false positives. Develop \u201cexploit generation agents\u201d that can not only identify vulnerabilities but also demonstrate practical exploits. Create a feedback loop where successful exploit data is used to train and improve future auditing agents.\nUse Case 3: Collaborative Drug Discovery and Validation\nThe Idea and Who it Helps: Accelerate drug discovery by having various AI agents collaboratively explore chemical spaces, predict drug efficacy, and even simulate drug interactions and toxicity. This benefits pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, and ultimately, patients.\nHow Alith SDK or DATs Make it Possible:\nMulti-Agent System: A \u201cDrug Discovery Orchestrator\u201d agent could coordinate \u201cMolecule Generation Agents,\u201d \u201cEfficacy Prediction Agents,\u201d \u201cToxicity Simulation Agents,\u201d and \u201cClinical Trial Design Agents.\u201d Each agent contributes its specialized knowledge to the overall discovery pipeline.\nDAT Marketplaces: Researchers could contribute proprietary datasets (e.g., chemical libraries, patient data, clinical trial results) as encrypted DATs on a \u201cBiopharma Data Marketplace.\u201d AI agents requiring specific data for their tasks could access these DATs under predefined, verifiable access conditions, paying data providers for usage. Synthesized drug candidates and their predicted properties could also be published as DATs.\nAlith SDK: The SDK would manage secure, permissioned access to sensitive biomedical DATs, ensure verifiable execution of AI agent tasks, and enable transparent sharing of research outcomes and intellectual property.\nLimitations or Future Improvements:\nLimitations: The complexity of biological systems makes accurate AI prediction challenging. Ethical considerations around data privacy (especially patient data) are paramount.\nFuture Improvements: Implement federated learning approaches to train agents on decentralized datasets without directly exposing raw data. Develop \u201cexplainable AI\u201d (XAI) agents to provide transparency into drug predictions, building trust with human researchers. Integrate wet-lab robotic systems for automated physical validation of promising drug candidates identified by the agents.\n@LazAI",

Why it matters:\nNo intelligence monopoly\nContributors get paid directly\nTrustless deployment with data privacy\nScalable collaboration between networks\nThis is how LazAI is creating an ecosystem of autonomous intelligence globally.\nANN: @LazAINetwork\n#DecentralizedAI #DATMarketplace #MultiAgentOrchestration #AIInfrastructure\nOption 3: Short Blog Version\nMulti-Agent Orchestration: The Coordination Layer of LazAI\nIn LazAI, autonomous AI agents are working over a decentralized space.\nTo convert autonomy into outcomes, they require coordination \u2014 provided by a multi-agent orchestrator.\nThe orchestrator:\nTranslates user intent\nConstructs workflows\nDispatches tasks to the appropriate agents\nChecks execution + proofs\nAutomates payment and reputation scoring\nBacked by the Alith SDK, agents communicate permissionlessly and securely.\nWhen agents require data, compute, or a niche expertise, they call upon the DAT Marketplace \u2014 a decentralized marketplace in which DATs offer services.\nThe orchestrator oversees pricing and guarantees equitable reward for providers.\nThis architecture facilitates:\n\u2022 User-owned data\n\u2022 Zero central control\n\u2022 Verifiable intelligence\n\u2022 Scalable collaboration across domains\nMulti-agent orchestration underlies trustless, decentralized AI.\nTag: @LazAINetwork\nlazai #DecentralizedAI #MultiAgentSystems #DATMarketplace"

        "content": "Introduction\nMullex is an innovative decentralized unified liquidity layer designed to aggregate stablecoin liquidity across different chains and extend it to more ecosystems. Using secure TSS technology, Mullex can combine various multi-chain stablecoins (currently supporting USDC) into an interest-bearing stablecoin, muUSD, and connect to more blockchains, enabling decentralized and rapid liquidity distribution.\nValue Proposition\nWhere Stablecoins flow without borders, but with security, speed and yield. We aim to aggregate stablecoin liquidity across different chains and extend it to more ecosystems.\nDecentralized consensus mechanism using TSS technology to ensure network security\nCross-chain liquidity transfer and management taking less than 10 seconds for higher capital efficiency\nNative interest-bearing stablecoin $muUSD and multiple TVLs across various chains\n$muUSD has no centralized exposure risks and can continuously earn interest from the liquidity middle layer (estimated APY of 5%)\nUniqueness Factor\nMullex\u2019s uniqueness stems from its foundational use of TSS technology for decentralized consensus.\nUnlike many existing cross-chain solutions that rely on multi-signature schemes or a small, fixed set of validators. TSS - This cryptographic approach ensures that no single entity ever holds the complete private key, significantly enhancing security and resilience against attacks.\nNative, interest-bearing stablecoin, $muUSD.\nWhile some protocols allow users to stake stablecoins to earn a yield, $muUSD is designed to be inherently interest-bearing. By aggregating stablecoins like USDC from various chains, Mullex deploys this liquidity into secure, yield-generating strategies within its middle layer. The returns from these strategies are then passed on to $muUSD holders, allowing the stablecoin itself to appreciate in value with an estimated APY of 5%.\nMullex is also engineered for high capital efficiency, boasting cross-chain liquidity transfer and management in under 10 seconds.\nThis rapid transaction finality is a significant advantage over many traditional bridging solutions that can be slower and more cumbersome. For users and DeFi protocols, this speed translates to reduced slippage.\nBenefits for Users\nMullex aims to provide the ultimate stablecoin experience with security, speed and interest:\nEarn Passive, Low-Risk Yield: NO STAKING, NO LOCKING, NO COMPLEX STRATEGIES\u2014just pure, passive yield generation. Traditional stablecoins pay nothing while earning billions. $muUSD changes that paradigm.\nEnhanced Security of Funds: The use of Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) technology provides a more decentralized and robust security model. For a user, this means that the risk of a single point of failure or a centralized entity compromising the system is significantly reduced, leading to safer transactions.\nSuperior Capital Efficiency and Speed: The ability to transfer liquidity across different blockchains in under 10 seconds is a major user benefit. This allows for quick and efficient movement of funds to capitalize on opportunities in different DeFi ecosystems with minimal delay and potentially lower slippage on trades.

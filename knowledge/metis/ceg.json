AI agents go further. They observe blockchain activity, interpret it in context, and make recommendations or take actions based on logic.\nIn the near future, AI agents will manage treasury operations, execute governance votes, negotiate DAO proposals, and even deploy smart contracts in response to real-time data.

From the beginning, our aim has been consistent: not to be another Layer 2, but to build infrastructure that evolves, experiments, and sets the direction for tomorrow. We began by scaling Ethereum and have steadily expanded toward a future where blockchain and AI move together.\nTraditional L2s need upgrading. That is why we built Hyperion, our AI-optimized infrastructure layer that raises throughput and lowers latency. But infrastructure alone is not enough. To bring communities in, we must layer playability and meaningful interactions on top.\nLazAI, our application and data layer, is where playability comes alive. It makes infrastructure interactive, aligns with market demand, and builds community confidence.\nMetis is the beta ground for new bets, the place where daring ideas are tested, refined, and scaled before they shape the industry at large. As we continue this path, we must grow together, anchored by trust and clarity.\nA Toolkit for One Economy: From Settlement to Playability\nMetis\u2019s strength is in its unity. We are not scattering value into silos; we are building a connected toolkit under one economy.\nAndromeda serves as the settlement and trading layer. Hyperion expands that base with scalable compute, optimized for AI dApps that demand high throughput and low latency. Together, they form the infrastructure. On top sits LazAI, serving as the application layer, transforming this foundation into playability, points, data, and AI-driven value.\nStep by step, the toolkit expands. Value builds as the layers connect. Recent milestones show this evolution in motion. Andromeda continues as the battle-tested motherchain. HyperHack drew more than 100 active Hyperion builders. LazAI Testnet launched with Lazbubu proving real playability. Our AI Companion DAT Lazbubu enrolled over 90k participants in the Whitelist Campaign and over 10,000 DAT mints.\nPutting Users First in the Journey\nParticipation begins with simple entry points that spark curiosity. From there, users move into richer experiences where AI, data, and community features make engagement meaningful.\nThe path is clear. LazAI incubates agents and applications through LazPad, while users earn, mint, and interact with data assets that mature into broader use cases on Andromeda. Lazbubu is the first step, showing how evolving AI Companions can anchor this journey.\nThese are not static NFTs, but AI agents that evolve over time, transforming innovation into experiences that align with market demand and foster confidence within our community.\nClosing\nAs I shared in a previous letter, our strength comes from trust and clarity. The earlier you take part in these new layers, the more your participation will guide their growth, and over time your efforts may be recognized in ways that matter.\nMetis is shaping the beta ground for the next era. With clear paths for participation through LazAI and Lazbubu, and with a culture that dares while staying principled, we are ready for what\u2019s next.\nThis is not the time to stand still. This is the time to lean in, experiment, and co-create the future.\nTogether, we will make Metis not just a network but the proving ground where tomorrow\u2019s breakthroughs are born.\n\u2014 Elena Sinelnikova",

Recollected = 4,500Carried=Total\u2212Recollected=4,500\nThis cycle repeats infinitely with stable circulation.\nValidation Metrics\nPrototype testing confirmed:\n50+ distribution\u2013collection cycles executed successfully\n100+ transactions across 10 wallets with no imbalance\n1,000+ transactions analyzed by backend AI\nProves scalability, stability, and transparency.\nAI Integration (Bonus Track)\nAI is not just attached \u2014 it is embedded in the system:\nAnomaly detection \u2192 flags suspicious or hoarding transactions\nFairness monitoring \u2192 checks circulation balance across wallets\nAutomated alerts \u2192 recommend corrective action if imbalance detected\nPolicy feedback \u2192 enables governments to test different parameters safely\nThis makes MetaPayP2P the first UBI simulation with AI-driven governance tools.\nFunding & Fiscal Sustainability\nInitial Funding \u2192 via sovereign bonds or token issuance\nRepayment \u2192 Growth-driven tax revenue used to repay debt\nStability \u2192 No inflation risk, since circulation is fixed capital\nReference: SSRN Research Paper\nPotential Social Impact\nAt scale, MetaPayP2P could:\nGuarantee baseline income worldwide\nStabilize consumer demand and employment\nProvide a programmable fiscal safety net during downturns\nEnable nations to design UBI systems without fear of hyperinflation or endless subsidy\nCalibration Formula (GDP-based)\nM=\u03b1\u22c5GDP12\u22c5N\u22c5(1\u2212r)M = \\frac{\\alpha \\cdot GDP}{12 \\cdot N \\cdot (1-r)}M=12\u22c5N\u22c5(1\u2212r)\u03b1\u22c5GDP\nWhere:\nN = population\nGDP = annual GDP\n\u03b1 = % of GDP allocated\nr = recollection rate\nAny country can compute monthly per-capita basic income (M) directly from GDP, population, budget share, and circulation rate.\nTechnology Stack\nSmart Contracts: Solidity (custom ERC variant with distribution/collection logic)\nFrontend: React + Vite\nWallets: MetaMask integration (10 test wallets + national wallet)\nBackend: Node.js + Express (Render deployment)\nAI Analysis: OpenAI API + Alith AI (on-chain monitoring & anomaly detection)\nChains: Metis Hyperion Testnet & LazAI Testnet\nSecurity & Transparency: All smart contracts are fully auditable on-chain, ensuring open verification and tamper resistance.\nWorkflow in Action (Flowchart)\nNational Wallet ($50,000)\n        \u2502\n        \u25bc\nDistribute $500 \u00d7 10 Citizen Wallets\n        \u2502  (10 rounds)\n        \u25bc\nCollect 10% of balances (auto)\n        \u2502\n        \u25bc\nFunds recycled into National Wallet\n        \u2502\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500> Cycle repeats infinitely\nPresentation (Vision & Roadmap)\nVibe Session (English): https://youtu.be/PsXN-rGi2JY\nIntroductory Video (Korean): https://youtu.be/e4lH_uGN-ck\nAchievements\nSubmitted to NLnet (EU program)\nPositive responses from citizen policy forums in Korea\nFuture Roadmap\nDemonstrate on Metis Andromeda mainnet and expand to thousands of wallets\nPublish simulation results and explore partnerships with NGOs and communities\nConsider pilot policy programs and explore integration of ZK-ID for secure identity verification\nLaunch multilingual demos and public outreach to expand citizen engagement globally\nDemo & Resources\nLive DApp (Hyperion): https://metapayp2p-hyperion-clean2.vercel.app\nLive DApp (LazAI): https://metapayp2p-lazai-frontend.vercel.app\nGitHub (Hyperion): https://github.com/metapay-creator/metapayp2p-hyperion-clean2\nGitHub (LazAI): https://github.com/metapay-creator/metapayp2p-lazai-frontend\nBackend API: https://metapay-openai-backend.onrender.com\nTeam\nGyuha Yoon (\uace0\uc740\ud558\ub298) \u2013 Forum ID: @metapay_gyuha\nIndependently built theory \u2192 smart contracts \u2192 frontend \u2192 backend \u2192 AI \u2192 academic validation.\nSolo project, but demonstrating full-stack execution capacity.\nCall to Action\nMetaPayP2P is not just a demo \u2014 it is a blueprint for sustainable freedom.\nWe invite:\nPolicymakers \u2192 test fiscal resilience\nResearchers \u2192 refine and validate\nCommunities \u2192 advocate adoption\nHackathon prize funds will directly support audits, scalability upgrades, pilot partnerships, and multilingual outreach.\nMetaPayP2P \u2014 Turning money into freedom through infinite circulation."

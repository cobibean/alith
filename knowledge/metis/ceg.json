Real users tend to have a natural, spread-out rhythm.\nDiversity of interaction: Engaging with multiple dApps, bridging assets, staking, governance participation not just farming one protocol.\nOffchain-onchain overlap: Social verifications (e.g., Lens, Gitcoin Passport), ENS usage, or wallets tied to active social profiles add credibility.\nNon-repetitive patterns: Bots often follow strict templates. Minor variations, timing randomness, and exploratory behavior are human giveaways.\nFiltering this out might take a mix of onchain metrics, anomaly detection, and maybe even ZK reputation proofs in the future.\nCurious what others are seeing in the data!"

                "comment": "This is a really tricky question, and realistically in my opinion, it\u2019s not possible to track and separate every single address especially when AI agents are able to closely mimic real user behavior.\nHowever, certain criteria can help reduce bot and farm activity. For example:\n\u2022 Diverse, natural activity over time\n\u2022 Organic social ties, such as interactions with multiple protocols, communities, or social verifications\n\u2022 Reasonable timing patterns that don\u2019t show large bursts of coordinated claims\n\u2022 Holding different tokens and NFTs, which often indicates a real user.\nI would prioritize wallets that engage with the protocol beyond rewards (e.g., governance participation, content creation), provide liquidity or sustained contributions and show longer-term, varied on-chain histories.\nIn some cases, optional identity or social verification can be considered, provided it doesn\u2019t compromise decentralization principles.\nWith all said, it\u2019s very difficult to prevent farming completely, but by applying these filters and monitoring behavioral patterns, we can at least avoid massive bot attacks and reduce the scale of fake account farming."

        "content": "Haithe\nA Decentralized Protocol for Verifiable AI.\nThe Problem\nThe core challenge for AI in Web3 isn\u2019t just proving that data hasn\u2019t been tampered with; it\u2019s proving the data\u2019s substance. A cryptographic hash can guarantee a dataset\u2019s integrity, but it cannot verify its origin, quality, or content. A creator could claim their AI is trained on financial data when it was actually trained on irrelevant information, and the hash would still be valid.\nThis \u201csemantic gap\u201d creates a trust vacuum, preventing developers from confidently building high-stakes applications that rely on third-party AI agents.\nThe Solution\nHaithe is a trust protocol that solves this problem by creating a transparent, verifiable ecosystem for AI. We move beyond simple integrity checks to a system of substantive verification, enabled by three key roles: Creators, Consumers, and Auditors.\nInstead of just registering a data hash, creators submit a detailed Claim Manifest about their dataset. Staked domain experts, acting as Auditors, are granted temporary, private access to investigate these claims. Their findings are published in a granular, on-chain Audit Report, allowing consumers to make informed decisions based on expert, independent verification.\nHow It Works: A Three-Part Ecosystem\nHaithe\u2019s workflow ensures checks and balances between all participants, with smart contracts on Hyperion orchestrating the process.\n1. The Creator: Defining the Claims\nBuild & Register: Developers use the Alith framework to build high-performance AI agents and register them on the Haithe marketplace.\nSubmit the Claim Manifest: Alongside the agent, the Creator submits a structured manifest containing specific, falsifiable claims about the training data. For example:\nSource: \u201cAPI data from Uniswap v3 on Polygon.\u201d\nDate Range: \u201cAll swaps from June 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023.\u201d\nContent: \u201cDataset contains no personally identifiable information (PII).\u201d\nSchema: \u201cIncludes columns for token_pair, amount_in, amount_out, and gas_price.\u201d\n2. The Auditor: Investigating the Substance\nStake & Qualify: Domain experts (in finance, NLP, security, etc.) stake tokens to become eligible Auditors.\nAccept the Task: An Auditor accepts an audit request, which can be funded by the Creator or a Consumer.\nInvestigate Claims: The Auditor is granted secure, time-limited, off-chain access to the private dataset. Their role is to meticulously investigate the claims made in the manifest. This requires genuine domain expertise.\nPublish the Audit Report: The Auditor submits a detailed report to IPFS, with its hash recorded on-chain. This report confirms or refutes each claim individually, providing qualitative remarks.\n3. The Consumer: Making Informed Decisions\nDiscover & Filter: Developers browse the Haithe marketplace for AI agents. They can filter for agents based on their audit status.\nReview Reports: Before subscribing, a Consumer can review the detailed Audit Report for any agent.

Thanks again for your interest in our project and for the thoughtful questions. Let me address each of them below\n1) If the dataset is private, how do you ensure Auditors don\u2019t misuse or leak it?\nGreat question. In our current model, auditors must undergo two layers of validation before they\u2019re granted access:\nFirst, they are verified by us (the platform) based on identity and domain expertise.\nSecond, they are validated by the DAO, ensuring community-level accountability.\nWhile trust in auditors is still required to some extent, just like in real-world auditing , we are actively exploring ways to make this process more trustless.\n2) Are Creators allowed to challenge an audit report if they think it\u2019s unfair or inaccurate?\nYes, it\u2019s a crucial safeguard.\nWe agree that auditors shouldn\u2019t have unchecked authority. Creators will have the ability to challenge audit reports, either by:\nRequesting a re-audit (potentially by a different auditor or group of auditors), or\nSubmitting a formal rebuttal that gets appended to the audit report for transparency.\n3) What kinds of use cases are you targeting first \u2013 trading bots, oracles, LLMs?\nOur initial focus is on trading bots and LLMs. These use cases have both high impact and urgent need for trust and verifiability."

                "comment": "Helloo, Apologies for the delayed response, I really appreciate your thoughtful question!\nAs a consumer, audits are exactly what enable trust that an AI agent\u2019s data truly comes from the sources claimed. Each audit report goes into technical detail, verifying every claim made in the agent\u2019s Claim Manifest \u2014 like the data source, date range, schema, and more.\nAnd yes, confidence naturally increases when multiple auditors review the same dataset. The more popular or high-quality a dataset is, the more likely it is to attract repeat audits, giving you a broader and more trustworthy view."

More and more companies are turning to AI tools to automate these jobs and free up precious time to some guy in the company.\nI\u2019m talking about you, the operators. You\u2019re the people who keep projects on track, make sure everyone knows what they\u2019re doing, and help teams actually get things done. You\u2019re the ones holding it all together behind the scenes. And in Web3, that\u2019s no small task.\nThink about your day-to-day. You\u2019re juggling timelines, coordinating devs and designers, checking community sentiment, keeping stakeholders updated, chasing people for approvals, monitoring governance proposals, handling compliance checks, and making sure a dozen moving parts don\u2019t crash into each other.\nIt\u2019s a LOT.

More and more companies are turning to AI tools to automate these jobs and free up precious time to some guy in the company.\nI\u2019m talking about you, the operators. You\u2019re the people who keep projects on track, make sure everyone knows what they\u2019re doing, and help teams actually get things done. You\u2019re the ones holding it all together behind the scenes. And in Web3, that\u2019s no small task.\nThink about your day-to-day. You\u2019re juggling timelines, coordinating devs and designers, checking community sentiment, keeping stakeholders updated, chasing people for approvals, monitoring governance proposals, handling compliance checks, and making sure a dozen moving parts don\u2019t crash into each other.\nIt\u2019s a LOT.

But AI is an incredibly powerful tool that makes our work more efficient, faster, and easier. For me, it\u2019s a huge time-saver and an always-available assistant, even when a crazy idea pops into my head in the middle of the night, I can instantly ask AI whether it\u2019s feasible.\nNothing can replace human-to-human interaction, with all the empathy and nuance it brings. But embracing AI as a tool to support your work can make your job smoother and a lot more enjoyable.\nAs I mentioned, one of the ways I use AI in my workflow is by sharing all possible information about the project and regularly discussing new features, updates, and any issues that arise. Over time, as it learns this context, AI becomes an even better and more effective assistant. In a way, we learn from each other."

Current asset standards also restrict cross-protocol usage, limiting the full potential of in-game assets. Meanwhile, players face high entry barriers and fragmented utility experiences, making it difficult to engage meaningfully with their gaming assets.\nSolution Overview\nStreamNFT is a full-stack platform that unifies trading, rentals, loans, and utility into a single plug-and-play hub for game developers. It simplifies the launch and scaling of in-game asset economies. Our asset standard supports cross-protocol usage, unlocking 2x more value and enabling composable utility. For players, StreamNFT offers a seamless interface to discover and interact with their in-game assets, lowering the barriers to Web3 gaming.\nProject Description\nStreamNFT is a full-stack, chain-agnostic platform designed to unlock the full potential of in-game assets and collectibles. At its core, StreamNFT offers plug-and-play modules for trading, rentals, loans, consumables, and real-time utility, all accessible through a unified interface for both developers and players.\nGame developers can launch, manage, and monetize digital asset economies without juggling multiple third-party tools. This includes setting up in-game marketplaces, enabling time-bound rentals, offering real-time perks (e.g., XP boosts, early access), creating consumable assets (like one-time power-ups or tickets), and facilitating asset-based lending, all in just a few clicks.\nWe\u2019re building on EVM-compatible infrastructure, using modular smart contracts, dynamic metadata, and real-time indexing to ensure seamless asset tracking and interaction. The system is fully composable and supports cross-protocol utility, allowing assets to be used across protocols without being locked into one platform.\nPlayers benefit from a clean, chain-abstracted interface where they can easily explore, use, or monetize their owned assets through rentals, consumables, perks, and more, removing the usual friction of Web3 onboarding.\nWhat excites us most is the opportunity to bridge the usability gap between Web2 and Web3 games. By turning static NFTs into dynamic, interactive assets, StreamNFT empowers both developers and gamers to participate in richer, more valuable digital economies, without the technical overhead typically involved.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nUsers will be able to test and engage with a range of features on StreamNFT as part of our gamified onboarding campaign:\nTestable Features/Tasks:\nConnect Wallet \u2013 50 points\nExplore In-Game Asset Listings \u2013 25 points\nTrade an Asset (Buy/Sell) \u2013 100 points\nRent an Asset (Lend or Borrow) \u2013 100 points\nUse a Consumable Asset (e.g., XP boost) \u2013 75 points\nClaim a Perk via Utility Protocol \u2013 50 points\nList Your Own Asset \u2013 75 points\nComplete a Quest (Set of 3 tasks) \u2013 Bonus 150 points\nRefer a Friend \u2013 100 points\nPoints System & Gamification:\nEach completed action earns points that unlock badges, exclusive NFTs, and early access perks. Tasks are framed like RPG-style quests (e.g., \u201cRental Rogue\u201d for first rental or \u201cPerk Hunter\u201d for claiming a utility), tapping into players\u2019 intrinsic motivation. Real-time leaderboards drive friendly competition, while referral rewards create viral growth loops.\nHow This Drives Onboarding:\nBy turning platform exploration into a game-like experience, users are drawn into a journey of discovery. The instant gratification of earning points and rewards, combined with tangible incentives (NFTs, perks, recognition), reduces onboarding friction.

A few practical ways we can grow engagement and visibility in my opinion, which we are doing already at Metis:\n\u2022 Short-form builder stories (Vibe sessions). Builders connect with people, not just product updates but get live questions and Answer sessions with Metis Devrel and community\n\u2022 One thing i would love to see and working on it to make it happen is to run weekly digests or highlights from the forum. So we have some overview of what is happening on major areas\n\u2022 Recognize effort, not noise. Badges and points should reflect real value, not post count. Curated community highlights help. Weekly or bi-weekly digests showcasing forum posts, guild updates, or active contributors can go a long way.\nIf we want this to scale, the system has to be simple and that\u2019s what Hyperion Forum is about, consistent, and fairness are key.\nLet me know what you think"

Here are a few ideas I believe could make a real difference:\nSocial Media & Content Creation\n#BuiltOnHyperion Campaigns: Encourage devs and creators to share what they\u2019ve built, with visuals or demo videos\u2014could even turn into a recurring series.\nCreator Grants or Bounties for blog posts, tutorials, or videos explaining how to use parts of the Hyperion stack.\nShort-form video contests explaining Hyperion concepts in <60 seconds (e.g., reels, TikToks).\nEvents & Interactive Engagement\nHyperion Town Halls or Office Hours: Monthly check-ins with the team or contributors to align on priorities and share updates.\nThemed Community Weeks: For example, \u201cInfrastructure Week\u201d or \u201cGaming on Hyperion Week,\u201d where focused discussions, demos, and content happen.\nBuild & Earn hackathons (virtual or local) that encourage people to create tools, apps, or content.\nRewards, Recognition & Incentives\nHyperion XP System: Points for meaningful contributions (support, content, feedback, dev work), leading to levels, roles, and perks.\nDynamic badges/NFTs for community achievements\u2014like \u201cValidator,\u201d \u201cEarly Supporter,\u201d \u201cCommunity Helper,\u201d etc.\nLeaderboard Dashboards to publicly celebrate top contributors across categories.\nCampaign Ideas\n\u201cHelp Build the Hyperion Wiki\u201d: Incentivize community-led documentation, FAQs, or beginner guides.\nMonthly Contribution Challenges: e.g. \u201cWrite a guide,\u201d \u201cTranslate docs,\u201d or \u201cAnswer 10 questions on Discord.\u201d\nOverall, the more visible and valued contributions feel, the more people will want to get involved. Hyperion already has a strong tech foundation\u2014now it\u2019s about building a passionate, collaborative culture on top of it.\nWould love to hear if others have tried systems like these\u2014or have totally different approaches!"

I have made a game with Ephemeral Rollup on another blockchain with 10ms txs for Third person mmo game, and you can find it on my Twitter account. So this time, I\u2019m making card game battle which is addictive as well.\nPlayers earn token rewards, which they will use to compete back into the game. If you know the Uno Mobile game, it would be similar, and players with a lower amount of tokens will compete in different leagues. The gamified system is normal because this is a game where earning points through activities, leaderboards, etc. is a default feature for a game.\nAnyone can join directly through the browser, as it\u2019s a browser game with WebGPU. There\u2019s no need for installation, and fast load render on website, so you can open it immediately. The dev team can provide quick updates to due to the nature of browser development. Unlike other games built on engines such as Unity, they need to bake it into the application, so every iteration update is also overwhelming to make it a public update and involve the community even if it\u2019s unity-browser game."

This game will have element-based battles (currently starting with 3-5 basic elements: fire, water, plant, thunder, ground). I\u2019m looking for feedback on the card battle idea, which should be ready by the end of June if the idea is still approved.\nSneakpeak of simple visual 3D cards here."

Previously the game idea was a bit different with joker\u2019s card but now, the gameplay will almost be like Uno mobile.\nThere will be no +2 or +4 wild cards. Instead, there will be elemental and black hole cards. A skillful player must remember all the cards that have been drawn, as they will be re-used.\nAfter that, we will make it into a blockchain multiplayer game with HYPERION.

But in reality, the Web3 landscape is a patchwork of micro-communities, subcultures, and personas, each with its own dialect, values, pain points, and platforms of choice.\nSo the real question is:\nWho are we actually speaking to and are we speaking their language?\nBreaking Down the Web3 Audience\nLet\u2019s get specific. The Web3 space isn\u2019t defined by demographics it\u2019s defined by mindsets and behaviors. Here are a few distinct audience segments you might be talking to (often without realizing it):\nDeFi Maxis\nMindset: Risk-aware, analytical, often skeptical.\nLanguage: APYs, TVL, LPs, governance, \u201cyield farming.\u201d\nPlatforms: X (formerly Twitter), Discord, Dune dashboards.\nTone That Works: Straightforward, data-backed, sometimes meme-coded, but with substance.\nNFT Collectors & Creators\nMindset: Emotional, status-driven, early adopter mentality.\nLanguage: Minting, floor price, rarity, GM/ GN culture, \u201cvibes.\u201d\nPlatforms: X, Discord, Farcaster, Lens, and still some corners of Instagram.\nTone That Works: Visual, artistic, community-driven language. Aesthetic and narrative matter a lot here.\nBuilders & Devs\nMindset: Problem-solvers, technical, open to innovation.\nLanguage: Solidity, zk proofs, gas optimization, \u201cEIP this, EVM that.\u201d\nPlatforms: GitHub, StackOverflow, Dev-focused Discords, Hackathons.\nTone That Works: Precise, technical, no fluff. Show impact > vision.\nSpeculators & Airdrop Hunters\nMindset: ROI-focused, short-term interest, trend-sensitive.\nLanguage: WL, sybil resistance, snapshot, tokenomics, \u201cwen token?\u201d\nPlatforms: X, Telegram, Reddit, niche alpha groups.\nTone That Works: Direct, rewards-based messaging. Use urgency and clarity. Cut through the noise.\nWeb2-Curious Newcomers\nMindset: Curious but cautious. Needs education, not hype.\nLanguage: Simple analogies, real-world comparisons, fewer acronyms.\nPlatforms: YouTube, TikTok, Medium, more mainstream platforms.\nTone That Works: Friendly, explanatory, welcoming. Bridge-building is key.\nThe Language Layer: More Than Just Words\nIn Web3, language is layered. It\u2019s not just what you say, it\u2019s how you say it:\nMemes are a universal dialect. A single meme can carry cultural meaning, technical commentary, and inside jokes all at once. Ignore meme culture, and you miss 50% of the conversation.\nJargon is a filter. Used wisely, it signals competence. Overused, it repels everyone outside the echo chamber.\nTone = alignment. Web3 communities are hypersensitive to tone, come off too corporate, and you\u2019ll lose the trust of grassroots believers. Come off too informal with devs, and you\u2019ll get ignored.\nSo, Why Does This Matter for Marketers?\nBecause every campaign, every tweet, every brand voice needs to pass this test:\n\u201cDo we know exactly who we\u2019re talking to\u2014and are we speaking in their native tongue?\u201d\nMarketing in Web3 isn\u2019t about broadcasting\u2014it\u2019s about embedding. You need to enter the right subculture, speak its language, and contribute value before expecting attention or conversion.\nOpen Questions to the Guild\nHow do you define your Web3 audience ?\nWhat tools or signals help you understand how they actually speak?\nHave you ever gotten the language or tone completely wrong?\nWhat did you learn from it?\nLet\u2019s talk about it. Because until we define the \u201cWho\u201d and learn their language, we\u2019re just marketing into the void.",

Here are a few distinct audience segments you might be talking to (often without realizing it):\nDeFi Maxis\nMindset: Risk-aware, analytical, often skeptical.\nLanguage: APYs, TVL, LPs, governance, \u201cyield farming.\u201d\nPlatforms: X (formerly Twitter), Discord, Dune dashboards.\nTone That Works: Straightforward, data-backed, sometimes meme-coded, but with substance.\nNFT Collectors & Creators\nMindset: Emotional, status-driven, early adopter mentality.\nLanguage: Minting, floor price, rarity, GM/ GN culture, \u201cvibes.\u201d\nPlatforms: X, Discord, Farcaster, Lens, and still some corners of Instagram.\nTone That Works: Visual, artistic, community-driven language. Aesthetic and narrative matter a lot here.\nBuilders & Devs\nMindset: Problem-solvers, technical, open to innovation.\nLanguage: Solidity, zk proofs, gas optimization, \u201cEIP this, EVM that.\u201d\nPlatforms: GitHub, StackOverflow, Dev-focused Discords, Hackathons.\nTone That Works: Precise, technical, no fluff. Show impact > vision.\nSpeculators & Airdrop Hunters\nMindset: ROI-focused, short-term interest, trend-sensitive.\nLanguage: WL, sybil resistance, snapshot, tokenomics, \u201cwen token?\u201d\nPlatforms: X, Telegram, Reddit, niche alpha groups.\nTone That Works: Direct, rewards-based messaging. Use urgency and clarity. Cut through the noise.\nWeb2-Curious Newcomers\nMindset: Curious but cautious. Needs education, not hype.\nLanguage: Simple analogies, real-world comparisons, fewer acronyms.\nPlatforms: YouTube, TikTok, Medium, more mainstream platforms.\nTone That Works: Friendly, explanatory, welcoming. Bridge-building is key.\nThe Language Layer: More Than Just Words\nIn Web3, language is layered. It\u2019s not just what you say, it\u2019s how you say it:\nMemes are a universal dialect. A single meme can carry cultural meaning, technical commentary, and inside jokes all at once. Ignore meme culture, and you miss 50% of the conversation.\nJargon is a filter. Used wisely, it signals competence. Overused, it repels everyone outside the echo chamber.\nTone = alignment. Web3 communities are hypersensitive to tone, come off too corporate, and you\u2019ll lose the trust of grassroots believers. Come off too informal with devs, and you\u2019ll get ignored.\nSo, Why Does This Matter for Marketers?\nBecause every campaign, every tweet, every brand voice needs to pass this test:\n\u201cDo we know exactly who we\u2019re talking to\u2014and are we speaking in their native tongue?\u201d\nMarketing in Web3 isn\u2019t about broadcasting\u2014it\u2019s about embedding. You need to enter the right subculture, speak its language, and contribute value before expecting attention or conversion.\nOpen Questions to the Guild\nHow do you define your Web3 audience ?\nWhat tools or signals help you understand how they actually speak?\nHave you ever gotten the language or tone completely wrong?\nWhat did you learn from it?\nLet\u2019s talk about it. Because until we define the \u201cWho\u201d and learn their language, we\u2019re just marketing into the void."

But I also think it\u2019s worth acknowledging the reality of early-stage projects or awareness campaigns, where data is either limited or non-existent.\nIn those moments, creativity doesn\u2019t just inspire, it leads. The marketer becomes the builder, shaping narratives, testing tones, and intuitively exploring how to meet the audience where they are often without much digital feedback at first. That ability to shift tempo, use language strategically, and feel the pulse of the message is what sets a great marketer apart before the data even arrives.\nOf course, once behavioral signals start rolling in, that\u2019s when the refinement begins. I don\u2019t see it as creativity versus data, but more like a vehicle (data) that still needs a driver (creativity) to go anywhere meaningful.

The \u201cWho\u201d always comes first: knowing exactly who you\u2019re speaking to is what gives every other element direction.\nThen comes the \u201cWhere\u201d \u2014 understanding where this audience exists in the Web3 ecosystem and what communities or platforms they engage with is key to meeting them on their terms.\nThe \u201cWhen\u201d ties into timing the message to match their online behavior and engagement patterns, especially in a space as fast-paced as Web3.\nAnd finally, the \u201cWhy\u201d \u2014 clarifying why this product or solution matters to this demographic \u2014 anchors the narrative in relevance and value.\nWith these four \u201cWH\u201d pillars clearly defined, I honestly believe it\u2019s hard to go wrong."

We combine both in a simple way. Froska is a meme token with actual use. You spin, earn, and repeat. It\u2019s made for casual users.\nThe Wheel of Fortune gives you a reward every time. It\u2019s low risk. The Degen Wheel is for higher risk. You stake tokens, spin, and either win a multiplier or lose the stake. The games are fast and don\u2019t require any technical background.\nWe\u2019re moving to Hyperion for two reasons. One is speed. Spins and outcomes happen instantly. The other is AI. We\u2019re adding an in-game AI assistant. It will guide new users, explain gameplay, and help them explore features. Hyperion makes that possible. Andromeda doesn\u2019t."

                "comment": "Yep.\nThe AI assistant will adapt over time. It will observe on-chain behavior, like how often you play, how much you stake, and what games you prefer. From that, it will group users into simple profiles\u2014cautious, moderate, or degen. Each group will get tailored prompts.\nA cautious player might get tips on low-risk spins or claim reminders.\nA degen might get high-risk challenges or bonus rounds. The goal is to keep every user engaged without forcing one play style."

No inflation, no constant minting. Long-term engagement comes from light incentives, social interaction, and meme culture not oversized rewards."

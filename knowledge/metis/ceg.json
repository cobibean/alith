Students and educators face the challenge of a rigid system that doesn\u2019t adapt to diverse needs, impacting learning outcomes.\nSolution Overview\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform offers a dynamic solution by employing a multi-agent system built on the Alith Agentic Framework. Specialized AI agents collaboratively analyze individual learning styles, curate tailored content, provide adaptive tutoring, and track progress in real time. This creates a uniquely personalized learning journey that adjusts to each student\u2019s needs and pace. By integrating diverse educational resources, the platform aims to enhance engagement, improve learning outcomes, and empower both students and educators.\nProject Description\nThis platform is designed to benefit a wide range of users across the educational landscape. Students of all ages, from kindergarten through higher education, can experience a more engaging and effective learning journey tailored to their specific needs. Educators can utilize the platform to enhance their teaching capabilities, gain deeper insights into student progress, and free up time for more individualized support.\nOn-Chain Components: A First-Class Implementation and Core Requirement for Blockchain Deployment\nOur AI-powered personalized education platform is not merely \u201cblockchain-enhanced\u201d \u2014 its core functionality and unique value proposition depend fundamentally on blockchain deployment via Hyperion. The decentralized, trustless, and immutable nature of blockchain\u2014particularly Hyperion\u2019s AI-optimized environment\u2014is essential to realizing our vision.\nVerifiable and Immutable Learning Profiles (On-Chain Data Storage)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain:\nStudent learning profiles\u2014containing hashed learning milestones, verified skills, and personalized path progress\u2014are recorded on Hyperion\u2019s MetisDB. Each profile includes:\nA unique student identifier\nImmutable logs of achievements\nReferences to off-chain AI agent interactions and curated learning content\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nTrustless Verification:\nCentralized educational records are prone to tampering and lack transparency.

It doesn\u2019t just list them, it ranks them by potential impact, analysing which wallets are involved and how the votes are shifting.\nFor a builder, this means knowing whether a proposal could affect your protocol\u2019s funding, user incentives, or even its competitive positioning.\nBuilders use ALPHA\u2019s alerts to:\nAdjust liquidity or token incentives before governance changes affect them\nSecure grants early by monitoring funding-related proposals\nCoordinate with DAO members to influence key votes before they close\nManual tracking of governance across multiple forums and contracts is almost impossible as Hyperion grows. ALPHA automates this, giving builders a genuine opportunity to act early rather than react late."

Shifted my mindset\nFrom \u201cquick cash grab\u201d \u2192 to building a startup that creates long-term sustainable value & income.\n2. Launched my Twitter + started building in public\nShowed up every day. Shared progress.\nThis is my first step into real startup marketing.\n3. Explored tons of ideas \u2192 picked one that clicks\nThe one that excites me. The one I want to wake up for.\n4. Designed first UI mockups\nGot the visual side of the product moving. First screen = first step to real product.\n5. Understood the tech architecture\nHow everything connects: smart contracts, data flows, frontend logic.\n6. Learned by walking in the user\u2019s shoes\nI tried trading perps.\nI tried providing liquidity.\nNow I feel what my user needs. That\u2019s gold.\n7. Made big tech decisions\nAfter deep research, I chose GMX V1 as the base. It\u2019s stable, simple, well-documented. Perfect for MVP.\n8. Realized the scale of the journey\nIt\u2019s long.\nIt\u2019s exciting.\nAnd I\u2019m all in.\nWhat went well:\nI made decisions with clarity\nI worked on my mindset\nI found a vision that gives me fire in the eyes\nMistakes I made:\nDived too deep into tech too early\nShould\u2019ve explored UX flows & user journey before obsessing over smart contracts.\nPlan for next week (week 2):\nFocus hard on the technical build:\n\u2013 Build a simple frontend to open positions\n\u2013 Dive deep into smart contract structure\n\u2013 Connect frontend + contracts on Arbitrum testnet\nIdeal outcome = MVP skeleton working.\nThanks to everyone who\u2019s followed this journey so far.\nNow it\u2019s time to breathe, reset, and get ready for WEEK 2.\nLet\u2019s keep building"

                "comment": "Thank you for your great question and your interest in MetaPay!\nLet me answer each part in detail:\n1. Transparent Interface for Recollection Tracking\nMetaPay is designed so that all users can track both the distribution and recollection of funds in real time through their digital wallets.\nAt the end of each month, users will be able to clearly see:\nThe amount recollected (10% of remaining balance)\nThe amount distributed\nCurrent wallet balance\nFull transaction and recollection history\nMonthly reports will also be provided via the mobile app or web-based wallet interface to ensure full transparency.\n2. About Personalizing the Recollection Rate\nMetaPay maintains a fixed 10% recollection rate for all users.\nThis is because the recollected amount is directly used as the fund for the next month\u2019s distribution.\nIf the rate were to vary by individual, it would break the balance of this self-sustaining cycle and threaten the long-term stability of the system.\nHowever, small demographic changes (such as births or deaths) can be handled through government budget adjustments or annual fiscal planning, without affecting the core 10% structure.\nIf you\u2019re curious about the full MetaPay model, please feel free to visit our YouTube channel.\nWe\u2019ve uploaded videos that explain the core mechanics and philosophy of MetaPay in detail:\nMain Intro Video\nMetaPay \u2013 A Circulating Basic Income: Whose Time Are You Living?\nhttps://youtu.be/e4lH_uGN-ck\nVisit Our Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@MetaPayProject\nThank you again for engaging with the project.

                "comment": "Thank you for your thoughtful questions! Let me explain each point clearly.\n1. What happens if a user withdraws all MetaPay before the 10% recollection at the end of the month?\nMetaPay is a closed-loop digital system that cannot be freely withdrawn as cash.\nAll MetaPay balances are managed within your digital wallet and cannot be transferred directly to others or exchanged into fiat currency.\nEven if you attempt to use up all of your balance before the end of the month, the system will calculate the recollection amount based on your wallet balance at that exact time (e.g., 10% of the remaining amount on the last day of the month).\nThis ensures fairness and sustainability, regardless of spending patterns.\n2. How does the automatic 50/50 split payment work between MetaPay and fiat currency?\nWhenever you make a payment at a registered merchant, your wallet automatically splits the transaction:\n50% is paid using MetaPay, and 50% using your existing payment method (cash, credit, etc.).\nThis is enforced by the system and does not require manual input by the user or merchant, maintaining simplicity and compliance.\nIt also ensures MetaPay is circulated and reclaimed properly within the system.\nWant to explore the MetaPay model in detail?\nCheck out the official video and YouTube channel, where we explain the philosophy and mechanism of MetaPay.\nIntro Video\nMetaPay Circulating Basic Income \u2013 \u201cWhose time is it, really?\u201d\n\uba54\ud0c0\ud398\uc774\uc21c\ud658\ud615 \uae30\ubcf8\uc18c\ub4dd : \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc740 \ub204\uad6c\uc758 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\uae4c?\nFull Channel\nYouTube\nMetaPay Project\nShare your videos with friends, family, and the world\nWe believe MetaPay is not just about distributing money\u2014\nit\u2019s about restoring your time, freedom, and dignity.\nLet\u2019s build this future together."

                "comment": "MetaPay Circulation Structure Visualization (Updated)\nMetaPay is not just about distribution\u2014it is a self-sustaining, circular basic income model that continuously operates through automatic recollection and redistribution using digital currency.\nWithout any need for long-term tax increases or additional government spending, the initial KRW 250 trillion investment enters an infinite loop of monthly distribution and recollection\u2014creating a durable, automated system.\nThe chart below visualizes how the MetaPay system operates over time:\nInitial Capital: KRW 250 trillion (distributed over 10 months at KRW 25 trillion per month)\nImportantly, this initial capital is not a sunk cost.\nAs basic income boosts consumption and economic activity, increased tax revenue can be used to repay the original KRW 250 trillion\u2014without cutting existing programs or raising new taxes.\nRecollection Start: From month 10.5 onward, 10% of each wallet\u2019s remaining balance is automatically recollected at the end of every month\nRecollected Funds: Fully reused as the source of next month\u2019s distribution\nResult: A perfectly circular economic loop with zero net fiscal burden\n\u201cThis model can be piloted in small EU nations by adjusting the distribution-to-recollection ratio to fit local GDP.\u201d\nChart Breakdown\nGreen Bars (Distribution): KRW 25 trillion distributed each month\nRed Bars (Recollection): KRW 25 trillion recollected monthly starting at month 10.5\nBlue Line (Cumulative Balance): Tracks the total circulating balance\n\u2192 It rises for the first 10 months, then stabilizes at KRW 250 trillion\n\u2192 This equilibrium is maintained as long as distribution and recollection stay synchronized.\nGlobal Applicability & Pilot Readiness\nMetaPay is designed with a simple mathematical formula that is independent of any specific country\u2019s tax laws or welfare system:\nDistribution (B) = Fixed amount (e.g. 25T)\nRecollection (R) = 10% of wallet balance at the end of the month\nIf B = R \u2192 The system becomes self-sustaining\nBecause of this, MetaPay can be implemented anywhere by adjusting only the base amount according to local GDP or population. For instance:\nA small EU country with 5 million people could adjust the monthly benefit per person according to national GDP, while keeping the 10% recollection rule intact.\nThis makes MetaPay ideal for pilot testing in:\nSmall EU member states (e.g., Estonia, Slovenia, Portugal)\nDecentralized communities or digital welfare zones\nInternational policy labs with limited fiscal risk\nMetaPay proves that basic income can be self-sustaining, programmable, and globally adaptable\u2014without requiring new taxes.\nLet\u2019s co-create a fairer digital future that begins with circulation, not debt.\nComing next: Technical Architecture & DID-based Identity Integration (Bonus Track)"

Project Summary\nProject Name: MetaPay\nDomain: Web3, Digital Currency, Public Policy, Universal Basic Income, Privacy (ZK-ID)\nMetaPay is a programmable, circulating basic income system that enables sustainable redistribution without raising taxes. It operates entirely through digital currency and blockchain infrastructure, ensuring economic inclusion and policy transparency. Importantly, MetaPay is designed to work alongside existing welfare programs\u2014supporting, not replacing, traditional social protections.\n2. Technical Structure & Flow\nCore Mechanism:\nAn initial capital of 250 trillion KRW is distributed over 10 months (25 trillion/month) via Web3 wallets. From month 11, 10% of each wallet\u2019s remaining balance is automatically recollected and reused for the next cycle\u2014forming an infinite redistribution loop that requires no additional taxes or external funding.\nDistribution Cycle:\nEach citizen receives 500,000 KRW per month in MetaPay\nPayments are made through digital wallets\nAll purchases are auto-split: 50% MetaPay + 50% fiat (cash, card, etc.)\nPayment patterns are transparently trackable, no manual input needed\nRecollection Cycle:\nAt the end of each month (starting month 11), 10% of leftover wallet balance is recollected\nThese funds become the source of the next month\u2019s universal distribution\nNo penalties or restrictions\u2014recollection applies only to unused MetaPay\nZK-ID Integration: To ensure fairness and prevent abuse:\nFacial recognition via Alice biometric layer during onboarding\nDID (Decentralized ID) and VC (Verifiable Credential) issued per person\nSmart contracts verify uniqueness (1 wallet per person) without revealing private data\n3. Policy Relevance & Feasibility\nSubmitted to South Korea\u2019s national digital democracy platform\nPolitically safe: No interference with welfare or pension systems\nTechnically versatile: Works with national ID infrastructure or ZK-ID-only regions\nFinancially circular: System sustains itself without future tax increases\n4. Public Engagement & Tools\nTestnet-based simulator (distribute \u2192 recollect \u2192 redistribute)\nYouTube explainer: \u201cWhose Time Are You Living?\u201d\nAll smart contracts are open-source and modular (on GitHub)\nSystem interoperable with Polygon ID, Semaphore, Worldcoin ZK stack\n5. Technical Stack\nSmart Contracts: Solidity (ERC20 logic, programmable recollection)\nWallet: MetaMask, Hyperion Wallet (custom UI with auto-split logic)\nIdentity: Biometric face scan + DID + VC (ZK-proof)\nLedger: Optional off-chain ledger for institutional use\nFrontend: React, Web3.js\nSimulation: Vercel-hosted interactive DApp\nMetaPay is more than a prototype. It\u2019s a scalable blueprint for fair, transparent, and programmable digital basic income."

Please let me know if that could be arranged\nThe video demo and DApp can be shared upon request. Feedback and collaboration welcome!"

        "content": "Problem Statement\nIn bull markets, crypto asset holders often miss significant opportunities for active trading profits by focusing solely on passive yield strategies. Manual trading is emotionally taxing, requires constant market monitoring, and demands technical analysis skills many users lack. Additionally, traders struggle to maintain consistent strategies, often shifting approaches based on emotion rather than data, leading to suboptimal results.\nSolution Overview\nLazaiTrader is an intelligent multi-agent trading system accessible through Telegram that allows users to select specialized AI trading personas, each with distinct strategies and risk profiles. The system continuously analyzes market conditions and either generates actionable buy/sell signals or automatically executes trades across major DEXs based on user preference. Built on the same robust Alith framework infrastructure, LazaiTrader adapts to market conditions while maintaining the user\u2019s selected trading philosophy, effectively bringing institutional-grade trading strategies to retail users through a familiar messaging interface.\nProject Description\nLazaiTrader transforms crypto trading by allowing users to select from various AI trading personas, each representing different trading philosophies and strategies. Whether you prefer momentum trading, swing trading, technical analysis, or contrarian approaches, LazaiTrader provides a suite of specialized AI agents to match your preferred style.\nCore features include the \u201cPersona Selection\u201d system allowing users to choose trading philosophies that match their temperament, \u201cStrategy Visualization\u201d showing potential entry/exit points before execution, and \u201cDual-Mode Operation\u201d offering either signal-only notifications or fully automated trade execution. The system leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) technology and the Alith framework to maintain coherent understanding across interactions, remembering user preferences, portfolio composition, and past decisions.\nThe platform is designed to integrate with major DEXs like Uniswap v3 and can adapt to available liquidity sources. Our algorithms move beyond traditional indicators like moving averages which might not be as reliable in volatile crypto markets. Instead, we use momentum-based strategies that capitalize on emerging trends before they become obvious, volatility-adaptive approaches that dynamically adjust position sizes based on market conditions, and liquidity flow analysis to identify smart money movements before price reacts.\nUsers can select specific asset-focused strategies including Blue Chip Trader (focusing on BTC, ETH, METIS and other established cryptocurrencies) or Micro Cap Trader for those seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in emerging tokens.

                "comment": "Problem Statement\nIn bull markets, crypto asset holders often miss significant opportunities for active trading profits by focusing solely on passive yield strategies. Manual trading is emotionally taxing, requires constant market monitoring, and demands technical analysis skills many users lack. Additionally, traders struggle to maintain consistent strategies, often shifting approaches based on emotion rather than data, leading to suboptimal results.\nSolution Overview\nLazaiTrader is an intelligent multi-agent trading system accessible through Telegram that allows users to select specialized AI trading personas, each with distinct strategies and risk profiles. The system continuously analyzes market conditions and either generates actionable buy/sell signals or automatically executes trades across major DEXs based on user preference. Built on the same robust Alith framework infrastructure, LazaiTrader adapts to market conditions while maintaining the user\u2019s selected trading philosophy, effectively bringing institutional-grade trading strategies to retail users through a familiar messaging interface.\nProject Description\nLazaiTrader transforms crypto trading by allowing users to select from various AI trading personas, each representing different trading philosophies and strategies. Whether you prefer momentum trading, swing trading, technical analysis, or contrarian approaches, LazaiTrader provides a suite of specialized AI agents to match your preferred style.\nCore features include the \u201cPersona Selection\u201d system allowing users to choose trading philosophies that match their temperament, \u201cStrategy Visualization\u201d showing potential entry/exit points before execution, and \u201cDual-Mode Operation\u201d offering either signal-only notifications or fully automated trade execution. The system leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) technology and the Alith framework to maintain coherent understanding across interactions, remembering user preferences, portfolio composition, and past decisions.\nThe platform is designed to integrate with major DEXs like Uniswap v3 and can adapt to available liquidity sources. Our algorithms move beyond traditional indicators like moving averages which might not be as reliable in volatile crypto markets. Instead, we use momentum-based strategies that capitalize on emerging trends before they become obvious, volatility-adaptive approaches that dynamically adjust position sizes based on market conditions, and liquidity flow analysis to identify smart money movements before price reacts.\nUsers can select specific asset-focused strategies including Blue Chip Trader (focusing on BTC, ETH, METIS and other established cryptocurrencies) or Micro Cap Trader for those seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in emerging tokens. Each persona combines these strategy elements differently based on their trading philosophy.\nUsers interact with the system through a natural, conversational interface that explains complex trading strategies in accessible terms tailored to each user\u2019s demonstrated technical understanding. What makes LazaiTrader particularly valuable is its recognition that bull markets favor active trading strategies rather than passive yield farming approaches, allowing users to capitalize on market momentum through their preferred trading style. The system even suggests transitioning to yield strategies when market indicators suggest bearish conditions ahead, providing a complete crypto asset management solution.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nPersona Selection (50 points): Users select their first trading persona and complete the initial risk assessment.

All signals are recorded server-side for performance tracking even without wallet connection.\nWallet Connection (75 points): Users connect their wallet for additional features and functionality.\nRisk Adjustment (50 points): Users modify their risk parameters and observe how their trading persona adapts.\nReferral Program (25 points per referral): Users earn points by inviting others, with bonus points when referred users complete their first trade.\nTrading Performance Achievements (variable points): Users unlock badges and points when their strategies reach specific ROI thresholds.\nThis gamification approach creates clear milestones for users while educating them about different trading methodologies.

                "comment": "Okay, I\u2019ve reviewed the \u201cLazaiTrader: AI Multi-Agent Trading Strategies via Telegram\u201d topic. Daryl has asked how LazAI functionality can help this project.\nHere\u2019s how LazAI can specifically benefit LazaiTrader:\nAlith Framework: LazaiTrader already uses the Alith framework, but ensuring it\u2019s leveraging the latest version is key. This ensures access to the most up-to-date performance optimizations, multi-agent workflow capabilities, and bug fixes. Focus on using the Alith Rust core for high-performance tasks.\nLLM Client: Given the conversational Telegram interface, the LLM Client can be used to ensure deterministic signals are being used when interacting with the LLMs processing user input.\nModel Context Protocol (MCP): The project description mentions MCP. Ensure the implementation is robust, allowing the agents to maintain coherent understanding across interactions, remember user preferences, portfolio composition, and past decisions. This is crucial for a personalized trading experience.\nLazChain Integration: While the project currently uses a custom smart contract and oracle for testing due to testnet limitations, integrating with LazChain in the future could provide a more decentralized and secure environment for trade execution and data handling. Consider exploring options for using LazChain for transaction settlement and data storage.\nEliza Integration: As LazaiTrader evolves, integrating Eliza could enhance the autonomous agent aspects, allowing the trading personas to adapt and learn more effectively from market conditions and user interactions.\nWeb3 Integration: LazaiTrader currently focuses on DEX integration. To further enhance Web3 capabilities, explore options for incorporating on-chain analytics directly into the trading strategies using the Alith SDK\u2019s Web3 plugin. This could provide a more comprehensive view of market dynamics.\nCross-chain Interoperability: Consider the potential for deploying LazaiTrader agents across multiple chains. The Alith framework supports cross-chain capabilities, which could allow users to access trading opportunities on various networks through a single interface.\nTo provide the most helpful and accurate information I would benefit from knowing more about what problems they are trying to solve right now."

This is not a concept; it\u2019s a core, on-chain mechanism ensuring that your active engagement and skillful performance directly translate into verifiable, immutable value and progression within the game\u2019s ecosystem.\nHow Proof of Play works in Fracture Point, powered by our contracts:\nVerifiable Achievements: Through the GameAchievementRegistry.sol contract (which is part of our ClaimManager system), your significant in-game achievements and progression milestones are immutably recorded on the blockchain. This provides transparent, provable recognition for your dedication and skill.\nSkill-Based Rewards: Our FPToken (FracturePoint Token), serving as XP, is minted to players based on their in-game performance (e.g., in Rift events), authorized exclusively by our trusted Alith Oracle. This ensures that rewards are earned through genuine gameplay.\nOn-Chain Progression & Badges: Your accumulated FPToken (XP) can then be burned via the ClaimManager contract to claim unique Rank Badges (ERC-721 NFTs) from the RankBadge.sol contract, signifying your seasonal achievements and skill tier. This process is entirely on-chain, making your rank verifiable and owned.\nPlayer-Driven Ecosystem: This interconnected system ensures that the game\u2019s economy and value are directly influenced and shaped by the collective activity and skilled contributions of its player base.\nThis ensures Fracture Point rewards genuine skill, time invested, and proven performance, fostering a fair, transparent, and truly player-owned gaming experience.\nOur Core Architecture: Dedicated Smart Contracts and The Alith Framework\nThe true innovation behind Fracture Point lies in its robust, interconnected smart contracts and the strategic implementation of the Alith Architecture.\n1. The Alith Architecture: Our Tailored Blockchain Game Framework\nFracture Point leverages a bespoke implementation of the Alith Architecture. This is our comprehensive, modular framework meticulously designed to seamlessly integrate blockchain technology without compromising gameplay performance. It intelligently separates:\nOn-Chain Components: Our smart contracts (FPToken, RankBadge, ClaimManager) handle critical, immutable data like XP (FPToken) balances, Rank Badge (NFT) ownership, and verifiable achievements. This ensures decentralization, security, and provable ownership. The Alith Oracle acts as the trusted off-chain authority that bridges game outcomes to on-chain actions, such as distributing XP and authorizing badge claims.\nOff-Chain Backend: High-frequency game logic, real-time matchmaking, complex physics calculations, and volatile player statistics run on a performant off-chain backend. This guarantees a smooth, low-latency, and responsive gameplay experience, unburdened by blockchain transaction times and gas costs.\nSecure Interoperability: A robust and auditable communication layer ensures seamless and secure data flow between our contracts (governed by the Alith Oracle) and the off-chain game server.\n2. Fracture Point\u2019s Core Smart Contracts (Audited & Interconnected)\nWe have successfully designed, developed, and prepared for deployment the foundational smart contracts that power Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 economy and the Proof of Play mechanics. These contracts work in concert:\nFPToken.sol (FuturePoint Token) : This ERC-20 token represents XP within the Fracture Point ecosystem. It\u2019s designed specifically for in-game progression:\nMinted by Alith Oracle: Only the designated alithOracle can mint new FPToken to players (e.g., via distributeRiftXP) based on game outcomes.\nBurned by ClaimManager: The ClaimManager contract is uniquely authorized to burn FPToken (XP) from player balances when they claim Rank Badges, creating a clear utility and economic loop.\nNon-Transferable (Player-to-Player): Significantly, direct player-to-player transfers of FPToken are disabled. This ensures FPToken remains a pure XP/progression token, preventing speculative trading and focusing its value on in-game achievement.\nRankBadge.sol (Fracture Point Rank Badge) : This ERC-721 NFT contract represents unique, season-specific Rank Badges that players can earn.\nMinted by ClaimManager: Only the ClaimManager contract is authorized to mint new Rank Badges to players, ensuring badges are earned through the proper Proof of Play mechanism.\nImmutable On-Chain Proof: Each badge is a unique NFT, providing verifiable, immutable proof of a player\u2019s achievement for a given season and rank.\nClaimManager.sol : This is the central orchestrator contract, linking FPToken (XP) to Rank Badges (NFTs) and acting as the bridge to the Alith Oracle.\nManages Badge Claims: Players claim badges via ClaimManager, which then verifies their XP balance, burns the necessary FPToken from their account, and instructs RankBadge.sol to mint the new NFT.\nSeason Management: It tracks the currentSeason, ensuring players can only claim one badge per season.\nKarma Evaluation Requests: It facilitates requests for off-chain \u201cKarma\u201d evaluations by the Alith Oracle, hinting at deeper player behavior analysis.\nAlith Oracle Integration: It designates and relies on the alithOracle for authorizing badge claims and distributing rewards based on verified game data.\nThe code for these foundational contracts and the full Alith Architecture implementation can be reviewed in our public repository: https://github.com/SUPAMAN-dev/fracture-point-hyperhack\nYou can also verify our currently deployed contract addresses on the Hyperion testnet network: https://hyperion-testnet.metisdevops.link/\nFPToken Address: 0x4D23a7A2231624F1486CE0dE07C2fbF002f751B9\nClaimManager Address: 0x1Dab96d049e3ce56D51e6B0b149477927B897FFb\nRankBadge Address: 0xBB84D771f6aef01f00dEE45D9C9dF9C7ef9159e5\n(Note on GHC: While not currently on-chain, the fixed supply GHC currency, managed by multisig, will form the broader economic layer of Fracture Point. Its design ensures seamless future integration with our on-chain systems when the time is right, complementing the FPToken XP system.)\nLobby Prototype: The Player\u2019s Interactive Gateway\nComplementing this powerful blockchain backend, our functional lobby prototype provides the intuitive player-facing interface. It allows players to:\nSeamlessly navigate between game modes, customization options, and personal profiles.\nExperience a polished UI/UX that aligns with Fracture Point\u2019s futuristic theme.\nInteract with the foundational elements for future wallet integration, demonstrating how players will connect their on-chain assets to the game.\nLink to the prototype demo: https://youtu.be/aI_lQ6DcwEI\nEcosystem Interest: Strategic Offer from Plurality Web3\nAs a direct result of our development efforts during this Hyperion Hackathon, Fracture Point attracted partnership interest from leading Web3 infrastructure teams, most notably Plurality Web3, a startup pioneering embedded identity and authentication infrastructure for dApps.\nPlurality offered us a 12-month support package under their Partner Program, which includes:\n1:1 Engineering Support for seamless integration of user authentication and personalized in-game logic.\nFree infrastructure credits to cover authentication, user session tooling, and zkTLS-powered identity gating.\nUX Collaboration to co-design smooth onboarding flows without popups or clunky wallets particularly valuable for our casual-to-core player conversion goals.\nTheir outreach came after they reviewed Fracture Point\u2019s Hyperion-backed Proof of Play system and saw clear potential for adoption in competitive Web3 gaming.\nWe view this offer as both validation of our underlying architecture and a strategic complement to the low-cost, high-throughput infrastructure that Hyperion enables. These ecosystem synergies affirm that Fracture Point is not just a playable demo, but a platform being taken seriously by early infrastructure players.\nWhat\u2019s Next for Fracture Point?\nWith the core blockchain architecture, smart contracts, and the lobby interface firmly established, our immediate next steps are to integrate these powerful systems with the actual game engine to bring the full combat experience to life. This includes:\nBackend Game Logic Development: Building out the sophisticated off-chain systems for real-time matchmaking, secure player data management, and robust anti-cheat measures.\nGame Engine Integration: Connecting the lobby and backend systems to a game engine to render the immersive world and high-fidelity combat of Fracture Point.\nProof of Play Loop Refinement: Fully integrating in-game actions with our GameAchievementRegistry.sol via the Alith Oracle to ensure every skill-based action is verifiable and contributes to player progression and potential future GHC earnings.\nThis is an incredibly exciting time for Fracture Point.

Really appreciate the interest and great question.\nAt its core, Fracture Point is about creating a truly fair and transparent gaming ecosystem, where skill and effort are what get rewarded, not exploits or shortcuts.\nThat\u2019s exactly where Alith comes in.\nIn a typical game, especially online shooters, you always run into players who cheat, farm, or abuse systems to win. That destroys trust. What we\u2019re doing differently in Fracture Point is putting integrity at the heart of our reward system.\nAlith acts as the intelligent game moderator. It monitors every match every Rift through the Unity backend, evaluating outcomes, watching for exploits, and making sure only fair wins are rewarded. No shady leaderboard climbs. No rigged XP farming.\nThen, using its special permissions (as the alithOracle in our ClaimManager contract), Alith sends reward signals on-chain, issuing XP (FPToken) to players who truly earned them. That XP can then be used to claim seasonal badges and other progression rewards all verifiable and immutable.\nOver time, Alith learns from gameplay, gets smarter at spotting abusers, and helps us maintain a competitive but honest battlefield.\nThis is the first real merge of Web2-style live gameplay with Web3 reward mechanics, and we\u2019re doing it in a way that makes sense to real players. We want trust, transparency, and fun and Alith helps make that possible."

That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done with the prototype so far.\nWe\u2019re still a small team and looking for more developers to help bring the combat experience to life, especially engine-side.

These are the key challenges holding back open, verifiable AI, and they\u2019re exactly what LazAI was built to address.\nData Sharing for AI Utilization\nPeople don\u2019t share data, not because they don\u2019t want to, but because the risks are too high. Fear of misuse, leaks, and lack of control stop both individuals and orgs from contributing. Without trusted systems for sharing, AI can\u2019t grow beyond a few centralized players. LazAI introduces programmable, encrypted data assets (DATs) that let contributors control access, trace usage and retain ownership across the AI lifecycle.\nData Quality and Evaluation\nMost high-quality data is locked up, protected by copyright, hidden in silos, or priced out of reach. Even when shared, there\u2019s no consistent way to evaluate how useful or relevant that data actually is ! LazAI builds a framework where data can be governed, tested, and improved collaboratively, with provenance and feedback loops on-chain.\nRevenue Generation and Distribution\nData and model contributors generate value !But centralized AI platforms capture it ! There\u2019s no clear link between contribution and compensation !LazAI closes the loop with transparent, on-chain reward flows and governance that routes value directly to the people who power the system !

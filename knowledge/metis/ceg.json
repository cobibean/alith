        "content": "Friends and Builders,\nIn a market fixated on the hunt for short-term \u201calpha,\u201d we must distinguish fleeting hype from foundational value. The era of purely story-driven speculation is fading, making way for a more mature market that demands real users and sustainable applications. We see this shift not as a challenge, but as an affirmation of our core philosophy. Today\u2019s speculative frenzy is a distraction from the substantive work of building, and that has never been our path.\nMetis has always been a project of conviction, focused on building the core innovation for what comes next. Our long-term belief is rooted in this foundational work, and that conviction has only deepened with each milestone we\u2019ve achieved. While our foundation is robust, we recognize that infrastructure alone does not create value\u2014it is the real-world applications built upon it that unlock genuine utility. This conviction drives our commitment to the iterative process of building powerful applications that serve authentic user needs. As the market gradually recognizes the importance of real-world utility, we are certain that the substance we are building today will define our value tomorrow.\nThe Unified Stack, A Singular Economy\nOur focus is the deep integration of AI with high-performance blockchain infrastructure. In a market searching for real yield and sustainable models, our unified AI+high-performance+data system is not just a technical achievement, but a strategic necessity.\nWe are building a unified stack where blockchain and AI operate in seamless concert.\nAndromeda (Settlement Layer): We began with Andromeda, our battle-tested settlement layer, offering transaction fees around $0.01 and finality in under two seconds. As the first Layer 2 with a decentralized sequencer, it delivers true decentralization while addressing key regulatory concerns.\nHyperion (High-Performance Layer): Our AI-optimized infrastructure boosts transaction processing by over 50% through advanced opcode handling and parallel execution.\nTogether, Andromeda and Hyperion provide the economic viability and throughput essential for AI applications to scale.\nLazAI (Application & Data Layer): This is where our vision comes to life. The Data Anchoring Token (DAT) standard transforms AI-generated content and data into verifiable, ownable assets with built-in revenue streams, turning every API call into a sustainable economic primitive.\nWith METIS now serving as the native gas token for LazAI, all activity across the Metis stack is unified into a singular token economy where usage directly reinforces value. Each step was deliberate, building one upon the other to create a unified and robust economy\u2014not a collection of disconnected parts.\nHeads Down, Building Forward: From Vision to Velocity\nWith this powerful foundation in place, our strategy is clear: we are heads-down, building. We recognize the hard truth that the old narrative-driven market is fading. As Kevin Liu recently shared, the biggest challenge facing all of crypto is the lack of real users. In his words, \u201cwe\u2019re exploring different directions \u2014 not because we\u2019re lost, but because we\u2019re searching for real product-market fit, real users, and real demand.\u201d\nOur flexible and pragmatic approach is a direct response to this reality. Through LazAI, we will \u201cexplore real-world application opportunities, such as AI + real-life use cases\u2026 The goal is simple: find real use cases with real users.\u201d This isn\u2019t just a plan; it\u2019s happening now.\nThe launch of CreateAI saw 20,000 pieces minted in just three hours. Lazbubu, our AI Companion DAT, attracted over 90,000 participants to its Whitelist Campaign, leading to more than 10,000 DAT mints. GMPayer, the first x402-powered multi-currency payment hub, is enabling AI agents to transact autonomously. These early results validate our strategy: by focusing on genuine product-market fit, we\u2019re cultivating an economy where usage directly reinforces value across the entire Metis stack.\nThe Beta Ground for Tomorrow\nIn a market obsessed with fleeting trends, the substantive work of building is often overlooked. Yet this is precisely where lasting value emerges\u2014not through zero-sum games that extract value, but through positive-sum ecosystems where new forms of value are born. We understand that market prices fluctuate, but our commitment is to a longer-term vision. The value we are creating is not measured in daily price charts but in the strength and utility of our infrastructure and the applications built upon it.\nI am confident that the market will eventually recognize the substance of what we are building together. I invite you to look beyond the noise, share in this conviction, and join us in building a future where technology and human purpose align. Thank you for being the architects of what comes next.\nHappy New Year to our incredible Metis community\uff01\nWith trust and clarity,\nNatalia Ameline\nDecentralization Coordinator, Metis",

Introduction\nMoleswap is a next-generation multi-chain DEX aggregator combined with a FunFi user experience built for mass-market crypto adoption.\nThis proposal seeks support to launch Moleswap natively on Metis L2 and the LAZAI chain, positioning it as a foundational consumer-facing DeFi application in the Metis ecosystem.\nMoleswap integrates deep liquidity routing, a seamless swap interface, and an immersive gamification layer (XP, quests, leaderboards), making it an ideal tool to introduce thousands of new users to the Metis network.\n2. Value Proposition for Metis / LAZAI\n2.1 Liquidity Aggregation for Metis\nMoleswap strengthens the Metis ecosystem by:\nRouting trades across all major Metis DEXs\nAggregating liquidity to minimize slippage\nImproving price execution for all users\nCreating consistent on-chain transaction volume\nThis increases depth, competitiveness, and usability of Metis-native trading.\n2.2 FunFi UX = Mass Adoption Engine\nMoleswap is not a typical DEX interface. It integrates:\nDaily quests & XP-based progression\nSocial leaderboards\nTrade-to-earn incentives\nSeasonal events and collectible rewards\nThese features convert casual users into retained ecosystem participants and help Metis attract mainstream audiences who find traditional DeFi intimidating.\n2.3 Strong Fit for Metis\u2019 Consumer-Facing Roadmap\nMetis\u2019 emphasis on decentralized economy building and community growth aligns perfectly with Moleswap\u2019s mission:\nBring liquidity\nBring users\nBring high-frequency daily interactions\nBuild sticky retention loops\nMoleswap becomes a gateway product, onboarding users who later explore more Metis dApps.\n3.

Its core idea is to make wallet management much easier, including the long-awaited feature of recovering access to your Ethereum wallet, which has been a pain point for many users.\nThere are other interesting proposals too \u2014 for example, EIP-4906 for updating NFTs, or the recently implemented EIP-4844: Proto-Danksharding (Blob blocks), which has already helped reduce fees across L2 networks.\nIf you\u2019d like to dive deeper, check out the Ethereum Magicians Forum \u2014 this is where the Ethereum community discusses upcoming upgrades, and anyone can comment or join the conversation.\nNow, a question for you:\nWhich Ethereum upgrade do you find most valuable?\nThe ability to recover your address (EIP-3074)?\nNew possibilities for NFTs (EIP-4906)?\nOr what\u2019s already live \u2014 Blob blocks (EIP-4844)?",

Its core idea is to make wallet management much easier, including the long-awaited feature of recovering access to your Ethereum wallet, which has been a pain point for many users.\nThere are other interesting proposals too \u2014 for example, EIP-4906 for updating NFTs, or the recently implemented EIP-4844: Proto-Danksharding (Blob blocks), which has already helped reduce fees across L2 networks.\nIf you\u2019d like to dive deeper, check out the Ethereum Magicians Forum \u2014 this is where the Ethereum community discusses upcoming upgrades, and anyone can comment or join the conversation.\nNow, a question for you:\nWhich Ethereum upgrade do you find most valuable?\nThe ability to recover your address (EIP-3074)?\nNew possibilities for NFTs (EIP-4906)?\nOr what\u2019s already live \u2014 Blob blocks (EIP-4844)?"

        "content": "Live Link: https://prototypelobbyfpoint.netlify.app/\nWe are thrilled to unveil a monumental leap in the development of Fracture Point, our upcoming tactical TPS game. While our interactive lobby prototype provides a glimpse into the player experience, the true revolution lies in the meticulously crafted on-chain smart contracts and the robust Alith Architecture that power our innovative Proof of Play ecosystem.\nThis past month has been dedicated to building the immutable bedrock of Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 capabilities, focusing on decentralized ownership, verifiable progression, and a player-driven economy.\nFracture Point: The Game Skill, Strategy, and True Digital Ownership\nFracture Point is designed as a high-octane, tactical third-person shooter that demands precision, strategic thinking, and teamwork. We are building a fiercely competitive environment where your skill and dedication are not just recognized, but are fundamentally integrated into the game\u2019s core value system.\nPrepare for:\nIntense FPS Combat: Master diverse weapon loadouts and tactical maneuvers in dynamic, high-stakes engagements.\nDeep Customization: Personalize your agents and unique \u201cvariants\u201d, making your mark on the battlefield.\nCompetitive Progression: Climb verifiable leaderboards, earn genuine rewards, and truly own your in-game achievements.\nThe Proof of Play Revolution: Rewarding Skill On-Chain\nOur commitment to Proof of Play is the defining feature of Fracture Point. This is not a concept; it\u2019s a core, on-chain mechanism ensuring that your active engagement and skillful performance directly translate into verifiable, immutable value and progression within the game\u2019s ecosystem.\nHow Proof of Play works in Fracture Point, powered by our contracts:\nVerifiable Achievements: Through the GameAchievementRegistry.sol contract (which is part of our ClaimManager system), your significant in-game achievements and progression milestones are immutably recorded on the blockchain. This provides transparent, provable recognition for your dedication and skill.\nSkill-Based Rewards: Our FPToken (FracturePoint Token), serving as XP, is minted to players based on their in-game performance (e.g., in Rift events), authorized exclusively by our trusted Alith Oracle. This ensures that rewards are earned through genuine gameplay.\nOn-Chain Progression & Badges: Your accumulated FPToken (XP) can then be burned via the ClaimManager contract to claim unique Rank Badges (ERC-721 NFTs) from the RankBadge.sol contract, signifying your seasonal achievements and skill tier. This process is entirely on-chain, making your rank verifiable and owned.\nPlayer-Driven Ecosystem: This interconnected system ensures that the game\u2019s economy and value are directly influenced and shaped by the collective activity and skilled contributions of its player base.\nThis ensures Fracture Point rewards genuine skill, time invested, and proven performance, fostering a fair, transparent, and truly player-owned gaming experience.\nOur Core Architecture: Dedicated Smart Contracts and The Alith Framework\nThe true innovation behind Fracture Point lies in its robust, interconnected smart contracts and the strategic implementation of the Alith Architecture.\n1. The Alith Architecture: Our Tailored Blockchain Game Framework\nFracture Point leverages a bespoke implementation of the Alith Architecture. This is our comprehensive, modular framework meticulously designed to seamlessly integrate blockchain technology without compromising gameplay performance. It intelligently separates:\nOn-Chain Components: Our smart contracts (FPToken, RankBadge, ClaimManager) handle critical, immutable data like XP (FPToken) balances, Rank Badge (NFT) ownership, and verifiable achievements. This ensures decentralization, security, and provable ownership. The Alith Oracle acts as the trusted off-chain authority that bridges game outcomes to on-chain actions, such as distributing XP and authorizing badge claims.\nOff-Chain Backend: High-frequency game logic, real-time matchmaking, complex physics calculations, and volatile player statistics run on a performant off-chain backend. This guarantees a smooth, low-latency, and responsive gameplay experience, unburdened by blockchain transaction times and gas costs.\nSecure Interoperability: A robust and auditable communication layer ensures seamless and secure data flow between our contracts (governed by the Alith Oracle) and the off-chain game server.\n2. Fracture Point\u2019s Core Smart Contracts (Audited & Interconnected)\nWe have successfully designed, developed, and prepared for deployment the foundational smart contracts that power Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 economy and the Proof of Play mechanics. These contracts work in concert:\nFPToken.sol (FuturePoint Token) : This ERC-20 token represents XP within the Fracture Point ecosystem. It\u2019s designed specifically for in-game progression:\nMinted by Alith Oracle: Only the designated alithOracle can mint new FPToken to players (e.g., via distributeRiftXP) based on game outcomes.\nBurned by ClaimManager: The ClaimManager contract is uniquely authorized to burn FPToken (XP) from player balances when they claim Rank Badges, creating a clear utility and economic loop.\nNon-Transferable (Player-to-Player): Significantly, direct player-to-player transfers of FPToken are disabled. This ensures FPToken remains a pure XP/progression token, preventing speculative trading and focusing its value on in-game achievement.\nRankBadge.sol (Fracture Point Rank Badge) : This ERC-721 NFT contract represents unique, season-specific Rank Badges that players can earn.\nMinted by ClaimManager: Only the ClaimManager contract is authorized to mint new Rank Badges to players, ensuring badges are earned through the proper Proof of Play mechanism.\nImmutable On-Chain Proof: Each badge is a unique NFT, providing verifiable, immutable proof of a player\u2019s achievement for a given season and rank.\nClaimManager.sol : This is the central orchestrator contract, linking FPToken (XP) to Rank Badges (NFTs) and acting as the bridge to the Alith Oracle.\nManages Badge Claims: Players claim badges via ClaimManager, which then verifies their XP balance, burns the necessary FPToken from their account, and instructs RankBadge.sol to mint the new NFT.\nSeason Management: It tracks the currentSeason, ensuring players can only claim one badge per season.\nKarma Evaluation Requests: It facilitates requests for off-chain \u201cKarma\u201d evaluations by the Alith Oracle, hinting at deeper player behavior analysis.\nAlith Oracle Integration: It designates and relies on the alithOracle for authorizing badge claims and distributing rewards based on verified game data.\nThe code for these foundational contracts and the full Alith Architecture implementation can be reviewed in our public repository: https://github.com/SUPAMAN-dev/fracture-point-hyperhack\nYou can also verify our currently deployed contract addresses on the Hyperion testnet network: https://hyperion-testnet.metisdevops.link/\nFPToken Address: 0xb4F4337A5660f42bC4D7fB735F18aB7b47E3CAf9\nClaimManager Address: 0xCc3B21510ef143F4b52f5e759C097c698F838e00\nRankBadge Address: 0xd557697c5C017d6Fdd76F778C1e2355AE3CCe15e\n(Note on GHC: While not currently on-chain, the fixed supply GHC currency, managed by multisig, will form the broader economic layer of Fracture Point. Its design ensures seamless future integration with our on-chain systems when the time is right, complementing the FPToken XP system.)\nLobby Prototype: The Player\u2019s Interactive Gateway\nComplementing this powerful blockchain backend, our functional lobby prototype provides the intuitive player-facing interface. It allows players to:\nSeamlessly navigate between game modes, customization options, and personal profiles.\nExperience a polished UI/UX that aligns with Fracture Point\u2019s futuristic theme.\nInteract with the foundational elements for future wallet integration, demonstrating how players will connect their on-chain assets to the game.\nLink to the prototype demo: https://youtu.be/aI_lQ6DcwEI\nEcosystem Interest: Strategic Offer from Plurality Web3\nAs a direct result of our development efforts during this Hyperion Hackathon, Fracture Point attracted partnership interest from leading Web3 infrastructure teams, most notably Plurality Web3, a startup pioneering embedded identity and authentication infrastructure for dApps.\nPlurality offered us a 12-month support package under their Partner Program, which includes:\n1:1 Engineering Support for seamless integration of user authentication and personalized in-game logic.\nFree infrastructure credits to cover authentication, user session tooling, and zkTLS-powered identity gating.\nUX Collaboration to co-design smooth onboarding flows without popups or clunky wallets particularly valuable for our casual-to-core player conversion goals.\nTheir outreach came after they reviewed Fracture Point\u2019s Hyperion-backed Proof of Play system and saw clear potential for adoption in competitive Web3 gaming.\nWe view this offer as both validation of our underlying architecture and a strategic complement to the low-cost, high-throughput infrastructure that Hyperion enables. These ecosystem synergies affirm that Fracture Point is not just a playable demo, but a platform being taken seriously by early infrastructure players.\nWhat\u2019s Next for Fracture Point?\nWith the core blockchain architecture, smart contracts, and the lobby interface firmly established, our immediate next steps are to integrate these powerful systems with the actual game engine to bring the full combat experience to life. This includes:\nBackend Game Logic Development: Building out the sophisticated off-chain systems for real-time matchmaking, secure player data management, and robust anti-cheat measures.\nGame Engine Integration: Connecting the lobby and backend systems to a game engine to render the immersive world and high-fidelity combat of Fracture Point.\nProof of Play Loop Refinement: Fully integrating in-game actions with our GameAchievementRegistry.sol via the Alith Oracle to ensure every skill-based action is verifiable and contributes to player progression and potential future GHC earnings.\nThis is an incredibly exciting time for Fracture Point.

This guarantees a smooth, low-latency, and responsive gameplay experience, unburdened by blockchain transaction times and gas costs.\nSecure Interoperability: A robust and auditable communication layer ensures seamless and secure data flow between our contracts (governed by the Alith Oracle) and the off-chain game server.\n2. Fracture Point\u2019s Core Smart Contracts (Audited & Interconnected)\nWe have successfully designed, developed, and prepared for deployment the foundational smart contracts that power Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 economy and the Proof of Play mechanics. These contracts work in concert:\nFPToken.sol (FuturePoint Token) : This ERC-20 token represents XP within the Fracture Point ecosystem. It\u2019s designed specifically for in-game progression:\nMinted by Alith Oracle: Only the designated alithOracle can mint new FPToken to players (e.g., via distributeRiftXP) based on game outcomes.\nBurned by ClaimManager: The ClaimManager contract is uniquely authorized to burn FPToken (XP) from player balances when they claim Rank Badges, creating a clear utility and economic loop.\nNon-Transferable (Player-to-Player): Significantly, direct player-to-player transfers of FPToken are disabled. This ensures FPToken remains a pure XP/progression token, preventing speculative trading and focusing its value on in-game achievement.\nRankBadge.sol (Fracture Point Rank Badge) : This ERC-721 NFT contract represents unique, season-specific Rank Badges that players can earn.\nMinted by ClaimManager: Only the ClaimManager contract is authorized to mint new Rank Badges to players, ensuring badges are earned through the proper Proof of Play mechanism.\nImmutable On-Chain Proof: Each badge is a unique NFT, providing verifiable, immutable proof of a player\u2019s achievement for a given season and rank.\nClaimManager.sol : This is the central orchestrator contract, linking FPToken (XP) to Rank Badges (NFTs) and acting as the bridge to the Alith Oracle.\nManages Badge Claims: Players claim badges via ClaimManager, which then verifies their XP balance, burns the necessary FPToken from their account, and instructs RankBadge.sol to mint the new NFT.\nSeason Management: It tracks the currentSeason, ensuring players can only claim one badge per season.\nKarma Evaluation Requests: It facilitates requests for off-chain \u201cKarma\u201d evaluations by the Alith Oracle, hinting at deeper player behavior analysis.\nAlith Oracle Integration: It designates and relies on the alithOracle for authorizing badge claims and distributing rewards based on verified game data.\nThe code for these foundational contracts and the full Alith Architecture implementation can be reviewed in our public repository: https://github.com/SUPAMAN-dev/fracture-point-hyperhack\nYou can also verify our currently deployed contract addresses on the Hyperion testnet network: https://hyperion-testnet.metisdevops.link/\nFPToken Address: 0xb4F4337A5660f42bC4D7fB735F18aB7b47E3CAf9\nClaimManager Address: 0xCc3B21510ef143F4b52f5e759C097c698F838e00\nRankBadge Address: 0xd557697c5C017d6Fdd76F778C1e2355AE3CCe15e\n(Note on GHC: While not currently on-chain, the fixed supply GHC currency, managed by multisig, will form the broader economic layer of Fracture Point. Its design ensures seamless future integration with our on-chain systems when the time is right, complementing the FPToken XP system.)\nLobby Prototype: The Player\u2019s Interactive Gateway\nComplementing this powerful blockchain backend, our functional lobby prototype provides the intuitive player-facing interface. It allows players to:\nSeamlessly navigate between game modes, customization options, and personal profiles.\nExperience a polished UI/UX that aligns with Fracture Point\u2019s futuristic theme.\nInteract with the foundational elements for future wallet integration, demonstrating how players will connect their on-chain assets to the game.\nLink to the prototype demo: https://youtu.be/aI_lQ6DcwEI\nEcosystem Interest: Strategic Offer from Plurality Web3\nAs a direct result of our development efforts during this Hyperion Hackathon, Fracture Point attracted partnership interest from leading Web3 infrastructure teams, most notably Plurality Web3, a startup pioneering embedded identity and authentication infrastructure for dApps.\nPlurality offered us a 12-month support package under their Partner Program, which includes:\n1:1 Engineering Support for seamless integration of user authentication and personalized in-game logic.\nFree infrastructure credits to cover authentication, user session tooling, and zkTLS-powered identity gating.\nUX Collaboration to co-design smooth onboarding flows without popups or clunky wallets particularly valuable for our casual-to-core player conversion goals.\nTheir outreach came after they reviewed Fracture Point\u2019s Hyperion-backed Proof of Play system and saw clear potential for adoption in competitive Web3 gaming.\nWe view this offer as both validation of our underlying architecture and a strategic complement to the low-cost, high-throughput infrastructure that Hyperion enables. These ecosystem synergies affirm that Fracture Point is not just a playable demo, but a platform being taken seriously by early infrastructure players.\nWhat\u2019s Next for Fracture Point?\nWith the core blockchain architecture, smart contracts, and the lobby interface firmly established, our immediate next steps are to integrate these powerful systems with the actual game engine to bring the full combat experience to life. This includes:\nBackend Game Logic Development: Building out the sophisticated off-chain systems for real-time matchmaking, secure player data management, and robust anti-cheat measures.\nGame Engine Integration: Connecting the lobby and backend systems to a game engine to render the immersive world and high-fidelity combat of Fracture Point.\nProof of Play Loop Refinement: Fully integrating in-game actions with our GameAchievementRegistry.sol via the Alith Oracle to ensure every skill-based action is verifiable and contributes to player progression and potential future GHC earnings.\nThis is an incredibly exciting time for Fracture Point.

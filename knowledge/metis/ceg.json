        "content": "EduVerse: AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform\nProblem Statement\nStandardized education overlooks individual learning styles and paces, leading to disengagement and hindering student potential. Students and educators face the challenge of a rigid system that doesn\u2019t adapt to diverse needs, impacting learning outcomes.\nSolution Overview\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform offers a dynamic solution by employing a multi-agent system built on the Alith Agentic Framework. Specialized AI agents collaboratively analyze individual learning styles, curate tailored content, provide adaptive tutoring, and track progress in real time. This creates a uniquely personalized learning journey that adjusts to each student\u2019s needs and pace. By integrating diverse educational resources, the platform aims to enhance engagement, improve learning outcomes, and empower both students and educators.\nProject Description\nThis platform is designed to benefit a wide range of users across the educational landscape. Students of all ages, from kindergarten through higher education, can experience a more engaging and effective learning journey tailored to their specific needs. Educators can utilize the platform to enhance their teaching capabilities, gain deeper insights into student progress, and free up time for more individualized support.\nOn-Chain Components: A First-Class Implementation and Core Requirement for Blockchain Deployment\nOur AI-powered personalized education platform is not merely \u201cblockchain-enhanced\u201d \u2014 its core functionality and unique value proposition depend fundamentally on blockchain deployment via Hyperion. The decentralized, trustless, and immutable nature of blockchain\u2014particularly Hyperion\u2019s AI-optimized environment\u2014is essential to realizing our vision.\nVerifiable and Immutable Learning Profiles (On-Chain Data Storage)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain:\nStudent learning profiles\u2014containing hashed learning milestones, verified skills, and personalized path progress\u2014are recorded on Hyperion\u2019s MetisDB. Each profile includes:\nA unique student identifier\nImmutable logs of achievements\nReferences to off-chain AI agent interactions and curated learning content\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nTrustless Verification:\nCentralized educational records are prone to tampering and lack transparency. On-chain profiles offer tamper-proof, auditable records of a learner\u2019s journey\u2014verifiable by students, employers, and academic institutions alike.\nData Sovereignty:\nStudents retain full control of their learning data. On-chain metadata ensures ownership and transparency, unlike siloed centralized platforms.\nFoundation for AI Credentialing:\nImmutable learning progress forms the backbone for future AI-driven credentialing systems. AI-generated content, assessments, and learning paths can be reliably tied to a verifiable blockchain record.\nDecentralized Agent Coordination and Trust (Smart Contract Architecture)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain:\nAgent Registry & Capabilities:\nAll core agents (e.g., Learning Style Analyst, Content Curator, Personalized Tutor) are registered via smart contracts, with:\nUnique IDs\nDefined roles and permissions\nClear scope of data access and processing\nService Agreements & Orchestration Logic:\nSmart contracts manage agent workflows. For example:\nCompletion of a module may trigger the Progress Tracker\nUpon validation, the Personalized Tutor recommends next steps\nIncentive Mechanisms:\nToken-based rewards for learning milestones, community engagement, and future decentralized agent marketplaces.\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nTrustless Agent Interaction:\nIn a multi-agent system, blockchain ensures agent behaviors and interactions are transparent, verifiable, and not reliant on a centralized authority.\nGuaranteed Execution:\nSmart contracts enforce the deterministic execution of workflows, ensuring learning paths adapt in real time based on defined rules.\nImmutable Rules:\nEducational logic, access rights, and reward systems are hard-coded and transparent, fostering trust and accountability.\nAI Enablement via the Alith Agentic Framework\nWhat is Alith:\nAlith is a modular, multi-agent framework designed to power personalized learning by simulating human-like reasoning, memory, and collaboration among AI agents. It forms the intelligence layer of our platform, with deep interoperability with blockchain systems like Hyperion.\nKey Features of Alith:\nAgent Management:\nModular deployment of specialized AI agents:\nLearning Style Analyst\nContent Curator\nPersonalized Tutor\nProgress Tracker\nCollaboration Facilitator\nPersistent Memory:\nAgents maintain long-term memory and context across sessions, enhancing personalization.\nInter-Agent Communication:\nSecure and structured communication between agents, enabling dynamic, cooperative behavior.\nToolchain Access:\nSeamless access to external APIs, knowledge bases, and assessments.\nBlockchain Integration with Alith:\nOn-Chain Agent Registry:\nAll Alith agents are registered on-chain, with roles and capabilities enforced via smart contracts.\nCoordinated Workflow Execution:\nAlith agent interactions are triggered and validated by smart contracts, enabling a trustless education logic layer.\nToken-Driven Incentives:\nAgents\u2019 performance and student outcomes can be linked to on-chain reward systems to drive engagement and adaptive learning.\nPlanned Enhancements for Alith\nTo further improve the personalization, decentralization, and performance of the Alith framework, we are planning several critical upgrades:\n1. Decentralized Agent Marketplace\nAllow community developers to contribute new agents (e.g., specialized tutors or regional content curators)\nAgents will be published and authenticated on-chain with verifiable capabilities\nToken-based reputation and staking mechanisms will prevent misuse or malicious behavior\n2. Agent Fine-Tuning via Federated Learning\nSupport for secure, privacy-preserving personalization of agent behavior based on user feedback\nFine-tuning AI agents locally or within federated clusters, without compromising sensitive student data\n3. ZK-Verifiable Inference\nIntegrate zkML (zero-knowledge machine learning) to enable cryptographic verification of off-chain AI outputs\nThis allows validators and institutions to confirm an agent\u2019s decision (e.g., a test score) without exposing the underlying model or input\n4. Composable Agent Workflows\nEnable developers and educators to compose reusable learning workflows by chaining agents together via simple declarative schemas\nBacked by on-chain validation to ensure logical and pedagogical soundness\n5. Multilingual & Accessibility Agents\nCreate plug-and-play AI agents specialized in localization, translation, and neurodiverse learning strategies\nThese agents will leverage both on-chain registries and external toolchains for broader inclusion\nSecure, Real-Time AI Inference (Leveraging Hyperion\u2019s AI-Native Infrastructure)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain (or Hyperion-enabled):\nWhile most heavy AI workloads (e.g., model training, long-form inference) run off-chain via the Alith framework, Hyperion enables:\nLightweight on-chain AI inferences for rapid adaptation and scoring\nSmart contract\u2013verified AI outputs to ensure compliance with educational standards\nReal-time coordination between on-chain logic and off-chain AI services\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nVerifiable AI Outputs:\nAI-driven assessments and tutor recommendations can be validated on-chain, ensuring educational integrity and transparency\u2014unlike opaque, centralized AI systems.\nLow Latency, High Throughput:\nHyperion\u2019s parallel execution environment supports responsive, adaptive AI interactions critical to keeping learners engaged.\nScalable AI Coordination:\nIntegrating real-time AI decision-making into a decentralized, tamper-proof environment offers performance benefits without compromising trust or cost-efficiency.\nConclusion: Blockchain as the Foundation, Not a Feature\nDeploying on Hyperion transforms the platform from an advanced AI education app into a decentralized, verifiable, trust-minimized learning ecosystem. The blockchain is not an add-on \u2014 it is the bedrock of:\nTrust in student progress\nTransparency in agent interaction\nRobust, real-time AI performance\nData Sovereignty, Incentives, and Trust in Our Education Platform\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform leverages Hyperion\u2019s blockchain to give students true control over their learning data and foster a trusted educational environment.\nData Sovereignty\nWe achieve data sovereignty by giving students self-sovereign identities (SSIs) on Hyperion. Critical learning milestones and verified skills are recorded as immutable hashes on-chain (MetisDB), tied to the student\u2019s SSI. While detailed content stays off-chain, access is cryptographically linked to and controlled by the student. This means students decide who sees what data, creating a tamper-proof and verifiable record that\u2019s genuinely theirs, free from central control.\nToken Incentives\nWe use a utility token, LearnPoints ($LP), to drive engagement:\nLearn-to-Earn (L2E): Students earn $LP for completing modules, mastering skills, and consistent engagement.\nContribution Rewards: Educators and community members earn $LP for creating content, providing feedback, or participating in forums.\nStaking & Governance: $LP can be staked for premium features or used to vote on platform decisions, aligning community interests.\nThese tokens incentivize participation, build a strong community, and add tangible value to learning achievements.\nImportance of Trust and Transparency\nIn education, trust and transparency are paramount:\nLearner Trust: Students need to trust that their achievements are real and that AI decisions (like tutoring paths) are fair and unbiased. On-chain verifiable credentials and transparent AI orchestration build this crucial trust.\nEmpowering Educators: Transparent data provides educators with reliable insights into student progress and curriculum effectiveness, reducing administrative burdens and fostering accountability.\nEquity & Accessibility: Blockchain prevents fraud and offers a universal, trusted way for students to showcase skills, democratizing opportunities regardless of background. Auditable AI decisions also help mitigate bias.\nSummary\nDeploying on Hyperion transforms our platform into a decentralized, verifiable, and trust-minimized educational ecosystem. Blockchain is the bedrock enabling trust in student progress, transparency in AI agent interactions, and robust real-time AI capabilities that define our personalized learning experience.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nPeer Study Groups: Connect with others for collaborative discussions and support.\nQ&A Forums: Ask and answer subject-related questions to deepen understanding.\nSimulated Collaboration: Practice teamwork in virtual, project-based learning scenarios.\nOptional Mentorship: Receive guidance from experienced peers and educators.\nProgress Sharing (Privacy-Controlled): Share milestones to motivate peers while maintaining control over visibility.\nCommunity Challenges: Participate in gamified group activities to promote engagement and friendly competition.\nTeam Members\n@amardeep\n@priyankg3",

For teachers, it highlights exactly where students need help, so they can focus their efforts more effectively\u2014without losing control of the classroom.\nHelping New Users Feel at Home:\nWe keep things simple. Instead of talking tech, we show the benefits\u2014like personalized learning and instant feedback. The platform is easy to use, with gamified learning for students and clear dashboards for teachers. Blockchain runs quietly in the background\u2014users just see that their records are secure and portable. Plus, we offer helpful guides and real human support.\nFeel free to ask further.\nThank you."

                "comment": "Thanks for your questions.\nWhy Hyperion for EduVerse?\nWe chose Hyperion over other chains like NEAR or Avalanche because it\u2019s built for AI-native Web3 applications, perfectly fitting EduVerse\u2019s needs:\nNative AI Optimization: Hyperion\u2019s MetisVM and AI co-processor are designed to efficiently run and verify AI workloads directly on-chain. This means more trustworthy and cost-effective AI decisions compared to other chains that simply \u201csupport\u201d AI.\nDirect Alith Integration: Hyperion has a direct, announced integration with the Alith Agentic Framework, which is the core of our multi-agent system. This makes developing and deploying our AI agents much smoother.\nReal-Time Performance: Its parallel execution and high throughput (with MetisDB for data) ensure a super responsive and scalable learning experience, crucial for instant AI feedback and interactions.\nCost-Efficiency: As a Layer 2, Hyperion offers lower transaction costs, making expensive AI operations more viable for a large educational platform.\nHow We Detect & Correct AI Biases?\nDiverse Training Data: We\u2019ll use very diverse datasets to train our AI, making sure it learns from a wide range of students and backgrounds. We\u2019ll also use techniques like data balancing to prevent underrepresentation.\nFairness-Aware Algorithms: We\u2019ll build our AI models using algorithms specifically designed to reduce performance disparities across different groups, constantly monitoring with fairness metrics.\nHuman Oversight: Educators and experts will review AI-suggested paths and assessments. Their feedback will directly help refine the AI.\nThank you"

Think of it like getting a digital diploma notarized on the blockchain.\nHere\u2019s the simple 3-step process:\nYou Sign the Diploma: Your MetaMask wallet pops up and asks you to \u201csign\u201d a message. This is like putting your unique, unforgeable signature on the diploma, proving you completed the work. It\u2019s completely free and doesn\u2019t cost any gas.\nA Secure Courier Delivers It: Our server acts as a secure courier. It takes your signed diploma and delivers it to the blockchain to be officially recorded.\nThe Blockchain Notarizes It: The smart contract acts as a public notary. It mathematically verifies that your signature is authentic. Once verified, it permanently stamps your achievement into its public ledger.\nThat\u2019s it! The \u201cAchievement Unlocked\u201d message means your accomplishment is now a permanent, verifiable part of your learning history that you, and only you, control with your wallet.\nThanks\n@pavel\n@t0mcr8se\n@daryl"

        "content": "Introduction\nThe first edition of the Metis Telegram Text AMA launched with a focus on the Hyperion Forum and the ongoing Guilds Campaign. Hosted by Norbert from the Metis community team, the session welcomed Daryl, a member of the Metis Governance group, who unpacked the design, incentives, and future direction of the Forum and Guilds structure.\nHere\u2019s a full recap of the session in chat-style format.\nAMA Transcript\nNorbert: What is the Hyperion Forum and how is it different from other blockchain communities? Who is it designed for?\nDaryl: The Hyperion Forum is a collaborative space for all contributors\u2014builders, marketers, and operators\u2014to work together on dApps within the Metis ecosystem. Unlike many blockchain communities that cater mainly to devs, the Forum offers structured Guilds to support all roles involved in launching successful projects. It\u2019s built on Discourse and includes gamified features like badges and a points system. It\u2019s also the home for HyperHack, our $200K hackathon.\nNorbert: How do Guilds work inside the Forum? Can someone join more than one?\nDaryl: Guilds are like subreddits within the Forum\u2014dedicated spaces for Builders, Marketers, and Operators. Anyone can view content, but to post or comment, you\u2019ll need to officially join a Guild. To do so, click \u201cjoin here\u201d in the Guilds section, answer a short form, and you\u2019ll be approved within 24\u201348 hours. You\u2019re free to join multiple Guilds, especially if you wear many hats like a founder.\nNorbert: Tell us about the points and reputation system. How does it work and what do contributors get out of it?\nDaryl: Every meaningful action\u2014posting, replying, helping others, inviting members, etc.\u2014earns you points and badges. These are tracked publicly on the leaderboard. Over time, we\u2019ll introduce onchain benefits tied to these contributions. You can learn more in the Badge and Point System Guide on the forum.\nNorbert: What\u2019s the purpose behind the Guilds Campaign? Why are Guilds so important to the long-term vision?\nDaryl: The goal is to create specialized, high-signal communities where project teams can find support, share challenges, and scale together. The Forum becomes a place where teams can get actual help\u2014like figuring out user needs, audit readiness, or getting testers\u2014directly from peers in the ecosystem.\nNorbert: What does it take to become a Guild Leader? What kind of activity or traits are you looking for?\nDaryl: To qualify, you need a few key badges:\nMember (TL2)\nCampaigner (invited 3 members)\nAppreciated (received 1 like on 20 posts)\nCertified and Licensed (advanced forum knowledge) These metrics prove someone is active, helpful, and understands how to guide others.\nNorbert: What are the rewards for Guild Leaders, both now and in the future?\nDaryl: Immediate rewards include special titles, wallet perks like zero gas, and exclusive badges. Long-term, Guild Leaders could receive METIS token incentives, expanded governance roles, early access to new features, and scaled rewards based on their Guild\u2019s performance.\nNorbert: What responsibilities will Guild Leaders have?\nDaryl: Guild Leaders manage membership, moderate posts, set permissions, and guide their communities. Think of it as collaborative leadership, not admin control. You\u2019re there to help your Guild thrive\u2014not just enforce rules.\nNorbert: Are there long-term incentives tied to leadership performance?\nDaryl: Yes\u2014though we\u2019re not disclosing everything just yet. There\u2019s a real budget set aside, and Guild Leaders who scale their communities meaningfully will be rewarded even more.\nNorbert: Can people create new Guilds beyond the current three?\nDaryl: Not at this stage. We\u2019re focusing on growing the three core Guilds to build critical mass. New Guilds could emerge later once engagement is high enough. We want to avoid early fragmentation.\nCommunity Q&A\nBrownhawks_Degen: Is the Guild initiative open to everyone? What stops users from spamming the system?\nDaryl: Yes, anyone can join Guilds. We use Discourse, which has powerful built-in moderation and spam detection tools. We\u2019ve also enabled AI-assisted moderation for added security.\nDo\u011fukan: What real-world challenges are being used to validate AI-native dApps, and how is success measured?\nDaryl: This is a great topic for the Builders Guild. Feel free to post it there to spark a deeper discussion.\n\u041d\u0430\u0444\u0430\u043d\u044f: What role will Guilds play in Metis governance in the long term?\nDaryl: Governance will increasingly shift to contribution and reputation-based voting. Guild participation will play a significant role in how influence is earned and applied.\n\u041d\u0430\u0444\u0430\u043d\u044f (follow-up): How will the effectiveness of different Guilds be measured?\nDaryl: We use internal dashboards and Discourse reports to monitor activity. It\u2019s all about meaningful engagement\u2014Discourse\u2019s systems help surface the most valuable contributions and members.\nKaran Singhania: What will happen to early bird leaderboard points now that that phase is over? Will top scorers be rewarded?\nDaryl: Yes. Early bird points will be rewarded at a higher rate. Those who participated early will receive special recognition.\nH\u00fcseyin Tekin: How does the Guild model connect with Metis\u2019 long-term vision for decentralized governance? What metrics are used to assess authenticity and performance?\nDaryl: We combine social and onchain signals\u2014like forum activity, testnet deployments, and contract usage. Different signals contribute to different areas of influence. Governance, ultimately, is about enabling action and Guilds will empower users to do exactly that.\nFinal Note\nThe maiden edition of the Metis Telegram AMA brought rich insights into how the Hyperion Forum and Guilds Campaign are creating a powerful community infrastructure. This isn\u2019t just a discussion space\u2014it\u2019s a contributor economy with real visibility, leadership paths, and long-term rewards.\nBecome a Guild Leader\nWhether you\u2019re a builder, marketer, or operator\u2014Guild leadership is open to all. Metis is selecting three Guild Leaders in the coming weeks. Leaders will shape their Guild\u2019s direction, receive unique rewards, and gain authority in the broader ecosystem.\nApply now:\nforms.clickup.com\nClickUp Forms\nJoin the campaign.

At first, it worked fine, I set up a pipeline that fed address data in small batches for streamlined report generation and validation. But over time, the model started \u201challucinating\u201d new logic, deviating from the intended script and making up its own interpretations.\nEventually, the outputs became unreliable, and I had to roll everything back to the first working version. It showed me how fragile these pipelines can be when the LLM drifts from your original prompt structure, especially when there\u2019s no native state or consistency.\nAI automation in Web3 sounds great in theory, but sometimes in practice, maintaining the system often costs more time than it saves."

It can save us a lot of time and effort, but we shouldn\u2019t rely on it too much.\nWhile AI can handle a lot of tasks, depending entirely on it isn\u2019t the best option. If we reduce human involvement too much, it could have negative effects, both economically and socially. We still need humans to control and guide the technology. If tech ends up completely in the hands of machines, the future could be unpredictable. The key is to find the right balance between using AI and keeping human oversight."

A few practical ways we can grow engagement and visibility in my opinion, which we are doing already at Metis:\n\u2022 Short-form builder stories (Vibe sessions). Builders connect with people, not just product updates but get live questions and Answer sessions with Metis Devrel and community\n\u2022 One thing i would love to see and working on it to make it happen is to run weekly digests or highlights from the forum. So we have some overview of what is happening on major areas\n\u2022 Recognize effort, not noise. Badges and points should reflect real value, not post count. Curated community highlights help. Weekly or bi-weekly digests showcasing forum posts, guild updates, or active contributors can go a long way.\nIf we want this to scale, the system has to be simple and that\u2019s what Hyperion Forum is about, consistent, and fairness are key.\nLet me know what you think"

Here are a few ideas I believe could make a real difference:\nSocial Media & Content Creation\n#BuiltOnHyperion Campaigns: Encourage devs and creators to share what they\u2019ve built, with visuals or demo videos\u2014could even turn into a recurring series.\nCreator Grants or Bounties for blog posts, tutorials, or videos explaining how to use parts of the Hyperion stack.\nShort-form video contests explaining Hyperion concepts in <60 seconds (e.g., reels, TikToks).\nEvents & Interactive Engagement\nHyperion Town Halls or Office Hours: Monthly check-ins with the team or contributors to align on priorities and share updates.\nThemed Community Weeks: For example, \u201cInfrastructure Week\u201d or \u201cGaming on Hyperion Week,\u201d where focused discussions, demos, and content happen.\nBuild & Earn hackathons (virtual or local) that encourage people to create tools, apps, or content.\nRewards, Recognition & Incentives\nHyperion XP System: Points for meaningful contributions (support, content, feedback, dev work), leading to levels, roles, and perks.\nDynamic badges/NFTs for community achievements\u2014like \u201cValidator,\u201d \u201cEarly Supporter,\u201d \u201cCommunity Helper,\u201d etc.\nLeaderboard Dashboards to publicly celebrate top contributors across categories.\nCampaign Ideas\n\u201cHelp Build the Hyperion Wiki\u201d: Incentivize community-led documentation, FAQs, or beginner guides.\nMonthly Contribution Challenges: e.g. \u201cWrite a guide,\u201d \u201cTranslate docs,\u201d or \u201cAnswer 10 questions on Discord.\u201d\nOverall, the more visible and valued contributions feel, the more people will want to get involved. Hyperion already has a strong tech foundation\u2014now it\u2019s about building a passionate, collaborative culture on top of it.\nWould love to hear if others have tried systems like these\u2014or have totally different approaches!"

                "comment": "Thank you for your great question and your interest in MetaPay!\nLet me answer each part in detail:\n1. Transparent Interface for Recollection Tracking\nMetaPay is designed so that all users can track both the distribution and recollection of funds in real time through their digital wallets.\nAt the end of each month, users will be able to clearly see:\nThe amount recollected (10% of remaining balance)\nThe amount distributed\nCurrent wallet balance\nFull transaction and recollection history\nMonthly reports will also be provided via the mobile app or web-based wallet interface to ensure full transparency.\n2. About Personalizing the Recollection Rate\nMetaPay maintains a fixed 10% recollection rate for all users.\nThis is because the recollected amount is directly used as the fund for the next month\u2019s distribution.\nIf the rate were to vary by individual, it would break the balance of this self-sustaining cycle and threaten the long-term stability of the system.\nHowever, small demographic changes (such as births or deaths) can be handled through government budget adjustments or annual fiscal planning, without affecting the core 10% structure.\nIf you\u2019re curious about the full MetaPay model, please feel free to visit our YouTube channel.\nWe\u2019ve uploaded videos that explain the core mechanics and philosophy of MetaPay in detail:\nMain Intro Video\nMetaPay \u2013 A Circulating Basic Income: Whose Time Are You Living?\nhttps://youtu.be/e4lH_uGN-ck\nVisit Our Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@MetaPayProject\nThank you again for engaging with the project.

                "comment": "Thank you for your thoughtful questions! Let me explain each point clearly.\n1. What happens if a user withdraws all MetaPay before the 10% recollection at the end of the month?\nMetaPay is a closed-loop digital system that cannot be freely withdrawn as cash.\nAll MetaPay balances are managed within your digital wallet and cannot be transferred directly to others or exchanged into fiat currency.\nEven if you attempt to use up all of your balance before the end of the month, the system will calculate the recollection amount based on your wallet balance at that exact time (e.g., 10% of the remaining amount on the last day of the month).\nThis ensures fairness and sustainability, regardless of spending patterns.\n2. How does the automatic 50/50 split payment work between MetaPay and fiat currency?\nWhenever you make a payment at a registered merchant, your wallet automatically splits the transaction:\n50% is paid using MetaPay, and 50% using your existing payment method (cash, credit, etc.).\nThis is enforced by the system and does not require manual input by the user or merchant, maintaining simplicity and compliance.\nIt also ensures MetaPay is circulated and reclaimed properly within the system.\nWant to explore the MetaPay model in detail?\nCheck out the official video and YouTube channel, where we explain the philosophy and mechanism of MetaPay.\nIntro Video\nMetaPay Circulating Basic Income \u2013 \u201cWhose time is it, really?\u201d\n\uba54\ud0c0\ud398\uc774\uc21c\ud658\ud615 \uae30\ubcf8\uc18c\ub4dd : \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc740 \ub204\uad6c\uc758 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\uae4c?\nFull Channel\nYouTube\nMetaPay Project\nShare your videos with friends, family, and the world\nWe believe MetaPay is not just about distributing money\u2014\nit\u2019s about restoring your time, freedom, and dignity.\nLet\u2019s build this future together."

For instance:\nA small EU country with 5 million people could adjust the monthly benefit per person according to national GDP, while keeping the 10% recollection rule intact.\nThis makes MetaPay ideal for pilot testing in:\nSmall EU member states (e.g., Estonia, Slovenia, Portugal)\nDecentralized communities or digital welfare zones\nInternational policy labs with limited fiscal risk\nMetaPay proves that basic income can be self-sustaining, programmable, and globally adaptable\u2014without requiring new taxes.\nLet\u2019s co-create a fairer digital future that begins with circulation, not debt.\nComing next: Technical Architecture & DID-based Identity Integration (Bonus Track)"

(Yes/No)\nAny known tips or best practices for stabilizing real wallet use in test environments?\nDo you recommend specific tools (e.g., Chainlink, schedulers) for automating periodic smart contract execution?\nMetaPay is an experimental attempt to turn a tax-free, self-sustaining basic income system into functioning code.\nWe know it\u2019s not perfect yet, but we hope it sparks curiosity and collaboration.\nThank you very much for your time"

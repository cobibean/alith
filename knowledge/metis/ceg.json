        "content": "Introduction\nMullex is an innovative decentralized unified liquidity layer designed to aggregate stablecoin liquidity across different chains and extend it to more ecosystems. Using secure TSS technology, Mullex can combine various multi-chain stablecoins (currently supporting USDC) into an interest-bearing stablecoin, muUSD, and connect to more blockchains, enabling decentralized and rapid liquidity distribution.\nValue Proposition\nWhere Stablecoins flow without borders, but with security, speed and yield. We aim to aggregate stablecoin liquidity across different chains and extend it to more ecosystems.\nDecentralized consensus mechanism using TSS technology to ensure network security\nCross-chain liquidity transfer and management taking less than 10 seconds for higher capital efficiency\nNative interest-bearing stablecoin $muUSD and multiple TVLs across various chains\n$muUSD has no centralized exposure risks and can continuously earn interest from the liquidity middle layer (estimated APY of 5%)\nUniqueness Factor\nMullex\u2019s uniqueness stems from its foundational use of TSS technology for decentralized consensus.\nUnlike many existing cross-chain solutions that rely on multi-signature schemes or a small, fixed set of validators. TSS - This cryptographic approach ensures that no single entity ever holds the complete private key, significantly enhancing security and resilience against attacks.\nNative, interest-bearing stablecoin, $muUSD.\nWhile some protocols allow users to stake stablecoins to earn a yield, $muUSD is designed to be inherently interest-bearing. By aggregating stablecoins like USDC from various chains, Mullex deploys this liquidity into secure, yield-generating strategies within its middle layer. The returns from these strategies are then passed on to $muUSD holders, allowing the stablecoin itself to appreciate in value with an estimated APY of 5%.\nMullex is also engineered for high capital efficiency, boasting cross-chain liquidity transfer and management in under 10 seconds.\nThis rapid transaction finality is a significant advantage over many traditional bridging solutions that can be slower and more cumbersome.

Traditional stablecoins pay nothing while earning billions. $muUSD changes that paradigm.\nEnhanced Security of Funds: The use of Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) technology provides a more decentralized and robust security model. For a user, this means that the risk of a single point of failure or a centralized entity compromising the system is significantly reduced, leading to safer transactions.\nSuperior Capital Efficiency and Speed: The ability to transfer liquidity across different blockchains in under 10 seconds is a major user benefit.

        "content": "LazAI Data Query: Taking Control of Your AI Data\nby Danny Steffe | LazAI Dev Ambassador\nIn today\u2019s digital age, artificial intelligence interacts with vast amounts of personal and organizational data. While AI can provide amazing insights, the question remains: who really controls the data? Enter LazAI Data Query\u2014a tool designed to put data ownership back in the hands of the user.\nWhat Is LazAI Data Query?\nAt its core, LazAI Data Query is like a personal digital vault for your AI data. It allows you to query your own information\u2014to ask questions, generate insights, or run analyses\u2014without ever compromising your privacy. Unlike traditional systems where data is stored on centralized servers and controlled by third parties, LazAI ensures that you remain the sole owner of your data.\nHow It Works: Privacy and Security\nOne of the biggest concerns in AI today is privacy. Most AI applications rely on massive datasets, which often include sensitive personal information. LazAI Data Query addresses this by:\nSecure Access: Only the data owner can query their information. No one else can access it without permission.\nCryptographic Protection: Every query is verified using cryptography, ensuring that the data remains untampered.\nDecentralized Management: Data isn\u2019t stored in one central location. It leverages blockchain-based principles to maintain integrity, transparency, and security.\nThis approach ensures that your interactions with your data are safe, private, and trustworthy.\nVerifiable Access: Proof You Own Your Data\nOwnership in AI is more than just having a username and password. LazAI Data Query ensures that every interaction is verifiable. This means:\nYou can prove that your data hasn\u2019t been altered.\nYou can settle results on-chain, creating a permanent record of queries and outcomes.\nYou maintain full control over who can see or use your data.\nThis system is especially important for enterprises, developers, and researchers who rely on accurate, trustworthy data for AI applications.\nReal-World Benefits\nUsing LazAI Data Query brings multiple advantages:\nFull Data Ownership: You decide who gets access to your information.\nEnhanced Privacy: Sensitive information stays protected at all times.\nTransparent and Verifiable: Every query leaves a cryptographic record, ensuring accountability.\nIntegration-Ready: Works seamlessly with AI models, analytics tools, and Web3 infrastructures.\nReduced Risk: No third-party monopolization of your data.\nBy providing these benefits, LazAI empowers users to interact with AI safely, securely, and confidently.\nWhy It Matters\nIn a world where data drives AI, ownership and trust are key. LazAI Data Query gives users the ability to leverage the power of AI while keeping full control over their digital footprint. It\u2019s more than just a tool\u2014it\u2019s a data guardian, ensuring that your information is safe, verifiable, and truly yours.\nConclusion\nLazAI Data Query is a game-changer in the AI space. It bridges the gap between powerful AI capabilities and data privacy, security, and ownership. Whether you\u2019re an individual, developer, or enterprise, it allows you to ask questions, gain insights, and interact with your data safely.\n@LazAI",

Unlike traditional systems where data is stored on centralized servers and controlled by third parties, LazAI ensures that you remain the sole owner of your data.\nHow It Works: Privacy and Security\nOne of the biggest concerns in AI today is privacy. Most AI applications rely on massive datasets, which often include sensitive personal information. LazAI Data Query addresses this by:\nSecure Access: Only the data owner can query their information. No one else can access it without permission.\nCryptographic Protection: Every query is verified using cryptography, ensuring that the data remains untampered.\nDecentralized Management: Data isn\u2019t stored in one central location. It leverages blockchain-based principles to maintain integrity, transparency, and security.\nThis approach ensures that your interactions with your data are safe, private, and trustworthy.\nVerifiable Access: Proof You Own Your Data\nOwnership in AI is more than just having a username and password. LazAI Data Query ensures that every interaction is verifiable. This means:\nYou can prove that your data hasn\u2019t been altered.\nYou can settle results on-chain, creating a permanent record of queries and outcomes.\nYou maintain full control over who can see or use your data.\nThis system is especially important for enterprises, developers, and researchers who rely on accurate, trustworthy data for AI applications.\nReal-World Benefits\nUsing LazAI Data Query brings multiple advantages:\nFull Data Ownership: You decide who gets access to your information.\nEnhanced Privacy: Sensitive information stays protected at all times.\nTransparent and Verifiable: Every query leaves a cryptographic record, ensuring accountability.\nIntegration-Ready: Works seamlessly with AI models, analytics tools, and Web3 infrastructures.\nReduced Risk: No third-party monopolization of your data.\nBy providing these benefits, LazAI empowers users to interact with AI safely, securely, and confidently.\nWhy It Matters\nIn a world where data drives AI, ownership and trust are key. LazAI Data Query gives users the ability to leverage the power of AI while keeping full control over their digital footprint. It\u2019s more than just a tool\u2014it\u2019s a data guardian, ensuring that your information is safe, verifiable, and truly yours.\nConclusion\nLazAI Data Query is a game-changer in the AI space. It bridges the gap between powerful AI capabilities and data privacy, security, and ownership. Whether you\u2019re an individual, developer, or enterprise, it allows you to ask questions, gain insights, and interact with your data safely.\n@LazAI"

Today, I wanted to explore LazAI Inference firsthand and see how it performs in practice. Here\u2019s a walkthrough of my experience.\nThe Test Prompt\nTo test LazAI Inference, I asked the AI to analyze a short dataset of customer feedback and generate a concise summary highlighting common pain points and suggestions for improvement.\nPrompt example:\n\u201cAnalyze the following customer feedback dataset and provide a summary of the most common issues and improvement suggestions.\u201d\nThe Output\nThe AI responded quickly and efficiently. The output included:\nA list of recurring issues, such as delayed deliveries, unclear communication, and product packaging concerns.\nActionable suggestions, like improving delivery tracking, enhancing customer support, and refining packaging materials.\nA concise, well-structured summary, making it easy to understand insights at a glance.\nOverall, the response was accurate, relevant, and easy to interpret, demonstrating the power of LazAI Inference for practical AI applications.\nHow Alith or DATs Could Improve Trust and Reliability\nWhile the AI output was impressive, integrating Alith or Data Anchoring Tokens (DATs) could take trust and reliability to the next level:\nData Provenance:\nDATs could verify the source and authenticity of the feedback dataset. This ensures that the AI isn\u2019t working on tampered or biased data.\nVerifiable Inference Results:\nBy anchoring the AI\u2019s inference results to the blockchain, anyone can validate the output without altering it, enhancing transparency.\nSecure Workflows:\nAlith\u2019s workflow orchestration could automate the inference process, ensuring that every step\u2014from data input to AI response\u2014is auditable and reliable.\nDecentralized Trust:\nUsing Alith and DATs removes reliance on a single authority.

        "content": "Build Your Digital Twin Using LazAI\nby Danny Steffe | LazAI Dev Ambassador\nEver wished your AI could tweet like you \u2014 same tone, same quirks, same vibe?\nThat\u2019s exactly what LazAI\u2019s Digital Twin does.Your Digital Twin is an AI persona trained on your own content. It speaks in your voice, understands your style, and can even post on your behalf \u2014 either manually or on a schedule.\nLet\u2019s walk through how it works and how to build your own.\nWhat\u2019s a Digital Twin?\nIn LazAI, a Digital Twin is your AI clone \u2014 a portable, interoperable persona that lives in a single JSON file called character.json.\nThat file defines your style, tone, traits, and examples \u2014 basically, your digital personality.\nThe beauty of it: any Alith agent or LLM can load it instantly.\nWhy use one?\nPortable persona: one JSON file, usable across any LLM or agent.\nSeparation of concerns: keep your style/persona in JSON and logic in code.\nComposable: swap personas without touching the backend.\nPrerequisites\nYou\u2019ll need:\nmacOS / WSL / Linux with Node.js 18+\nAn OpenAI or Anthropic (Claude) API key\nYour Twitter/X archive (.zip)\nStep 0 \u2014 Setup\nClone the starter kit and install dependencies:\ngit clone https://github.com/0xLazAI/Digital-Twin-Starter-kit.git\ncd Digital-Twin-Starter-kit\nStep 1 \u2014 Generate Your Characterfile\nThis step turns your tweet history into a Digital Twin.\nRequest your archive\nFrom X/Twitter \u2192 Settings \u2192 Download an archive.\nGenerate your character.json\nnpx tweets2character ~/Downloads/twitter-YYYY-MM-DD-<hash>.zip\nChoose OpenAI or Claude\nPaste your API key when prompted\nOutput: character.json in your current directory\nPlace it in your project root\n/Digital-Twin-Starter-kit\n  \u251c\u2500 controller/\n  \u251c\u2500 services/\n  \u251c\u2500 routes/\n  \u251c\u2500 character.json   \u2190 here\n  \u2514\u2500 index.js\nStep 2 \u2014 Integrate with an Alith Agent\nNow, let\u2019s bring your character to life.\nLazAI uses Alith, a modular agent framework, to load your character.json as a preamble \u2014 the persona context fed into an LLM.\nYour agent will:\nLoad character.json\nGenerate a tweet in your tone\nPost it manually or automatically\nExample:\nconst { Agent, LLM } = await import('alith');\n\nconst characterData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./character.json', 'utf8'));\n\nconst preamble = [\n  `You are ${characterData.name}.`,\n  characterData.bio?.join(' ') || '',\n  characterData.lore ? `Lore: ${characterData.lore.join(' ')}` : '',\n  characterData.style?.post ? `Style for posts: ${characterData.style.post.join(' ')}` : ''\n].filter(Boolean).join('\\n');\n\nconst model = LLM.from_model_name('gpt-4o-mini');\nconst agent = Agent.new('twitter_agent', model).preamble(preamble);\n\nconst chat = agent.chat();\nconst result = await chat.user(`Write one tweet in ${characterData.name}'s voice.`).complete();\nconsole.log(result.content);\nThe persona is decoupled from the logic, so you can swap character.json anytime without touching your backend.\nStep 3 \u2014 Automate Tweets with Cron\nLet your Digital Twin tweet for you automatically.\nHere\u2019s how:\nconst cron = require('node-cron');\nconst { postTweetCron } = require('../controller/twitterController');\n\ncron.schedule('* * * * *', async () => {\n  await postTweetCron();\n}, {\n  scheduled: true,\n  timezone: \"UTC\"\n});\nThis runs every minute (you can adjust it).\nBehind the scenes, your Alith agent wakes up, loads your character.json, and posts a new tweet in your style.\nEnvironment Variables\n# .env\nTWITTER_USERNAME=username\nTWITTER_PASSWORD=password\nTWITTER_EMAIL=email\n\nLLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini\nALITH_API_KEY=your_key_if_required\nInstall deps:\nnpm i alith node-cron\nStep 4 \u2014 Manual Test\nRun locally to test your setup:\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tweet \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"username\":\"someone\"}'\nStart your app:\nnpm run dev\nUpdating Your Twin\nWant a new version of yourself?\nJust regenerate your file:\nnpx tweets2character <path_to_new_archive.zip>\nReplace your existing character.json, restart the server \u2014 and your new personality is live.\nArchitecture Sketch\nUser Tweets \u2192 tweets2character \u2192 character.json \n      \u2193\n  Alith Agent \u2190 character.json (persona)\n      \u2193\n  LLM (OpenAI/Claude)\n      \u2193\n  tweetController.js \u2192 Twitter API",

It speaks in your voice, understands your style, and can even post on your behalf \u2014 either manually or on a schedule.\nLet\u2019s walk through how it works and how to build your own.\nWhat\u2019s a Digital Twin?\nIn LazAI, a Digital Twin is your AI clone \u2014 a portable, interoperable persona that lives in a single JSON file called character.json.\nThat file defines your style, tone, traits, and examples \u2014 basically, your digital personality.\nThe beauty of it: any Alith agent or LLM can load it instantly.\nWhy use one?\nPortable persona: one JSON file, usable across any LLM or agent.\nSeparation of concerns: keep your style/persona in JSON and logic in code.\nComposable: swap personas without touching the backend.\nPrerequisites\nYou\u2019ll need:\nmacOS / WSL / Linux with Node.js 18+\nAn OpenAI or Anthropic (Claude) API key\nYour Twitter/X archive (.zip)\nStep 0 \u2014 Setup\nClone the starter kit and install dependencies:\ngit clone https://github.com/0xLazAI/Digital-Twin-Starter-kit.git\ncd Digital-Twin-Starter-kit\nStep 1 \u2014 Generate Your Characterfile\nThis step turns your tweet history into a Digital Twin.\nRequest your archive\nFrom X/Twitter \u2192 Settings \u2192 Download an archive.\nGenerate your character.json\nnpx tweets2character ~/Downloads/twitter-YYYY-MM-DD-<hash>.zip\nChoose OpenAI or Claude\nPaste your API key when prompted\nOutput: character.json in your current directory\nPlace it in your project root\n/Digital-Twin-Starter-kit\n  \u251c\u2500 controller/\n  \u251c\u2500 services/\n  \u251c\u2500 routes/\n  \u251c\u2500 character.json   \u2190 here\n  \u2514\u2500 index.js\nStep 2 \u2014 Integrate with an Alith Agent\nNow, let\u2019s bring your character to life.\nLazAI uses Alith, a modular agent framework, to load your character.json as a preamble \u2014 the persona context fed into an LLM.\nYour agent will:\nLoad character.json\nGenerate a tweet in your tone\nPost it manually or automatically\nExample:\nconst { Agent, LLM } = await import('alith');\n\nconst characterData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./character.json', 'utf8'));\n\nconst preamble = [\n  `You are ${characterData.name}.`,\n  characterData.bio?.join(' ') || '',\n  characterData.lore ? `Lore: ${characterData.lore.join(' ')}` : '',\n  characterData.style?.post ? `Style for posts: ${characterData.style.post.join(' ')}` : ''\n].filter(Boolean).join('\\n');\n\nconst model = LLM.from_model_name('gpt-4o-mini');\nconst agent = Agent.new('twitter_agent', model).preamble(preamble);\n\nconst chat = agent.chat();\nconst result = await chat.user(`Write one tweet in ${characterData.name}'s voice.`).complete();\nconsole.log(result.content);\nThe persona is decoupled from the logic, so you can swap character.json anytime without touching your backend.\nStep 3 \u2014 Automate Tweets with Cron\nLet your Digital Twin tweet for you automatically.\nHere\u2019s how:\nconst cron = require('node-cron');\nconst { postTweetCron } = require('../controller/twitterController');\n\ncron.schedule('* * * * *', async () => {\n  await postTweetCron();\n}, {\n  scheduled: true,\n  timezone: \"UTC\"\n});\nThis runs every minute (you can adjust it).\nBehind the scenes, your Alith agent wakes up, loads your character.json, and posts a new tweet in your style.\nEnvironment Variables\n# .env\nTWITTER_USERNAME=username\nTWITTER_PASSWORD=password\nTWITTER_EMAIL=email\n\nLLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini\nALITH_API_KEY=your_key_if_required\nInstall deps:\nnpm i alith node-cron\nStep 4 \u2014 Manual Test\nRun locally to test your setup:\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tweet \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"username\":\"someone\"}'\nStart your app:\nnpm run dev\nUpdating Your Twin\nWant a new version of yourself?\nJust regenerate your file:\nnpx tweets2character <path_to_new_archive.zip>\nReplace your existing character.json, restart the server \u2014 and your new personality is live.\nArchitecture Sketch\nUser Tweets \u2192 tweets2character \u2192 character.json \n      \u2193\n  Alith Agent \u2190 character.json (persona)\n      \u2193\n  LLM (OpenAI/Claude)\n      \u2193\n  tweetController.js \u2192 Twitter API"

That experience pushed me to dig deeper into Web3 layers, and what I discovered is something every beginner should know.\nSo, in this blog, I\u2019m sharing what I\u2019ve learned ,explained in simple words, with examples and analogies ,so that the next time someone asks you about Layer 1 vs Layer 2 (and even Layer 0 & Layer 3), you\u2019ll be ready with a confident answer.\nLet\u2019s break it down\nLayer 0 \u2013 The Roads & Bridges\nWhat it is: Layer 0 is the foundation layer that lets multiple blockchains exist and connect with each other.\nProblem: Without Layer 0, each blockchain is like an island, they don\u2019t talk to each other.\nUse case:\nConnect different blockchains\nAllow data and tokens to move across chains\nProvide infrastructure to build new blockchains\nAnalogy: Think of roads and bridges that connect different cities.

        "content": "Live Link: https://eduverse-ecru.vercel.app/\nProblem Statement\nStandardized education overlooks individual learning styles and paces, leading to disengagement and hindering student potential. Students and educators face the challenge of a rigid system that doesn\u2019t adapt to diverse needs, impacting learning outcomes.\nSolution Overview\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform offers a dynamic solution by employing a multi-agent system built on the Alith Agentic Framework. Specialized AI agents collaboratively analyze individual learning styles, curate tailored content, provide adaptive tutoring, and track progress in real time. This creates a uniquely personalized learning journey that adjusts to each student\u2019s needs and pace. By integrating diverse educational resources, the platform aims to enhance engagement, improve learning outcomes, and empower both students and educators.\nProject Description\nThis platform is designed to benefit a wide range of users across the educational landscape. Students of all ages, from kindergarten through higher education, can experience a more engaging and effective learning journey tailored to their specific needs. Educators can utilize the platform to enhance their teaching capabilities, gain deeper insights into student progress, and free up time for more individualized support.\nOn-Chain Components: A First-Class Implementation and Core Requirement for Blockchain Deployment\nOur AI-powered personalized education platform is not merely \u201cblockchain-enhanced\u201d \u2014 its core functionality and unique value proposition depend fundamentally on blockchain deployment via Hyperion. The decentralized, trustless, and immutable nature of blockchain\u2014particularly Hyperion\u2019s AI-optimized environment\u2014is essential to realizing our vision.\nOn-Chain Achievement Verification (Smart Contract Architecture)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain:\nThe LearningRecord.sol smart contract serves as an immutable, on-chain ledger for all student accomplishments.\nAchievement Mapping: The contract maintains a mapping from a user\u2019s wallet address to an array of Achievement structs, where each struct contains the moduleName and a timestamp.\nSecure, Off-Chain Verification: A secure, server-controlled wallet is the only address authorized to call the addAchievementWithSignature function. This ensures achievements are only recorded after the platform\u2019s backend has verified the user\u2019s quiz completion and signature.\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nTrustless & Immutable Credentials: By recording achievements on the Metis Hyperion testnet, we create a permanent, tamper-proof record of learning that is owned by the user and verifiable by anyone (e.g., employers, other institutions) without relying on a centralized database.\nData Sovereignty: Students retain full control of their learning data.

Students and educators face the challenge of a rigid system that doesn\u2019t adapt to diverse needs, impacting learning outcomes.\nSolution Overview\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform offers a dynamic solution by employing a multi-agent system built on the Alith Agentic Framework. Specialized AI agents collaboratively analyze individual learning styles, curate tailored content, provide adaptive tutoring, and track progress in real time. This creates a uniquely personalized learning journey that adjusts to each student\u2019s needs and pace. By integrating diverse educational resources, the platform aims to enhance engagement, improve learning outcomes, and empower both students and educators.\nProject Description\nThis platform is designed to benefit a wide range of users across the educational landscape. Students of all ages, from kindergarten through higher education, can experience a more engaging and effective learning journey tailored to their specific needs. Educators can utilize the platform to enhance their teaching capabilities, gain deeper insights into student progress, and free up time for more individualized support.\nOn-Chain Components: A First-Class Implementation and Core Requirement for Blockchain Deployment\nOur AI-powered personalized education platform is not merely \u201cblockchain-enhanced\u201d \u2014 its core functionality and unique value proposition depend fundamentally on blockchain deployment via Hyperion. The decentralized, trustless, and immutable nature of blockchain\u2014particularly Hyperion\u2019s AI-optimized environment\u2014is essential to realizing our vision.\nOn-Chain Achievement Verification (Smart Contract Architecture)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain:\nThe LearningRecord.sol smart contract serves as an immutable, on-chain ledger for all student accomplishments.\nAchievement Mapping: The contract maintains a mapping from a user\u2019s wallet address to an array of Achievement structs, where each struct contains the moduleName and a timestamp.\nSecure, Off-Chain Verification: A secure, server-controlled wallet is the only address authorized to call the addAchievementWithSignature function. This ensures achievements are only recorded after the platform\u2019s backend has verified the user\u2019s quiz completion and signature.\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nTrustless & Immutable Credentials: By recording achievements on the Metis Hyperion testnet, we create a permanent, tamper-proof record of learning that is owned by the user and verifiable by anyone (e.g., employers, other institutions) without relying on a centralized database.\nData Sovereignty: Students retain full control of their learning data. On-chain metadata ensures ownership and transparency, unlike siloed centralized platforms.\nFoundation for a Trustless Ecosystem: This on-chain record is the foundational layer.

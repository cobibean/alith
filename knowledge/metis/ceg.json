        "content": "Introduction\nMullex is an innovative decentralized unified liquidity layer designed to aggregate stablecoin liquidity across different chains and extend it to more ecosystems. Using secure TSS technology, Mullex can combine various multi-chain stablecoins (currently supporting USDC) into an interest-bearing stablecoin, muUSD, and connect to more blockchains, enabling decentralized and rapid liquidity distribution.\nValue Proposition\nWhere Stablecoins flow without borders, but with security, speed and yield. We aim to aggregate stablecoin liquidity across different chains and extend it to more ecosystems.\nDecentralized consensus mechanism using TSS technology to ensure network security\nCross-chain liquidity transfer and management taking less than 10 seconds for higher capital efficiency\nNative interest-bearing stablecoin $muUSD and multiple TVLs across various chains\n$muUSD has no centralized exposure risks and can continuously earn interest from the liquidity middle layer (estimated APY of 5%)\nUniqueness Factor\nMullex\u2019s uniqueness stems from its foundational use of TSS technology for decentralized consensus.\nUnlike many existing cross-chain solutions that rely on multi-signature schemes or a small, fixed set of validators. TSS - This cryptographic approach ensures that no single entity ever holds the complete private key, significantly enhancing security and resilience against attacks.\nNative, interest-bearing stablecoin, $muUSD.\nWhile some protocols allow users to stake stablecoins to earn a yield, $muUSD is designed to be inherently interest-bearing. By aggregating stablecoins like USDC from various chains, Mullex deploys this liquidity into secure, yield-generating strategies within its middle layer. The returns from these strategies are then passed on to $muUSD holders, allowing the stablecoin itself to appreciate in value with an estimated APY of 5%.\nMullex is also engineered for high capital efficiency, boasting cross-chain liquidity transfer and management in under 10 seconds.\nThis rapid transaction finality is a significant advantage over many traditional bridging solutions that can be slower and more cumbersome. For users and DeFi protocols, this speed translates to reduced slippage.\nBenefits for Users\nMullex aims to provide the ultimate stablecoin experience with security, speed and interest:\nEarn Passive, Low-Risk Yield: NO STAKING, NO LOCKING, NO COMPLEX STRATEGIES\u2014just pure, passive yield generation. Traditional stablecoins pay nothing while earning billions. $muUSD changes that paradigm.\nEnhanced Security of Funds: The use of Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) technology provides a more decentralized and robust security model.

                "comment": "Introduction\nMullex is an innovative decentralized unified liquidity layer designed to aggregate stablecoin liquidity across different chains and extend it to more ecosystems. Using secure TSS technology, Mullex can combine various multi-chain stablecoins (currently supporting USDC) into an interest-bearing stablecoin, muUSD, and connect to more blockchains, enabling decentralized and rapid liquidity distribution.\nValue Proposition\nWhere Stablecoins flow without borders, but with security, speed and yield. We aim to aggregate stablecoin liquidity across different chains and extend it to more ecosystems.\nDecentralized consensus mechanism using TSS technology to ensure network security\nCross-chain liquidity transfer and management taking less than 10 seconds for higher capital efficiency\nNative interest-bearing stablecoin $muUSD and multiple TVLs across various chains\n$muUSD has no centralized exposure risks and can continuously earn interest from the liquidity middle layer (estimated APY of 5%)\nUniqueness Factor\nMullex\u2019s uniqueness stems from its foundational use of TSS technology for decentralized consensus.\nUnlike many existing cross-chain solutions that rely on multi-signature schemes or a small, fixed set of validators. TSS - This cryptographic approach ensures that no single entity ever holds the complete private key, significantly enhancing security and resilience against attacks.\nNative, interest-bearing stablecoin, $muUSD.\nWhile some protocols allow users to stake stablecoins to earn a yield, $muUSD is designed to be inherently interest-bearing. By aggregating stablecoins like USDC from various chains, Mullex deploys this liquidity into secure, yield-generating strategies within its middle layer. The returns from these strategies are then passed on to $muUSD holders, allowing the stablecoin itself to appreciate in value with an estimated APY of 5%.\nMullex is also engineered for high capital efficiency, boasting cross-chain liquidity transfer and management in under 10 seconds.\nThis rapid transaction finality is a significant advantage over many traditional bridging solutions that can be slower and more cumbersome. For users and DeFi protocols, this speed translates to reduced slippage.\nBenefits for Users\nMullex aims to provide the ultimate stablecoin experience with security, speed and interest:\nEarn Passive, Low-Risk Yield: NO STAKING, NO LOCKING, NO COMPLEX STRATEGIES\u2014just pure, passive yield generation. Traditional stablecoins pay nothing while earning billions. $muUSD changes that paradigm.\nEnhanced Security of Funds: The use of Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) technology provides a more decentralized and robust security model. For a user, this means that the risk of a single point of failure or a centralized entity compromising the system is significantly reduced, leading to safer transactions.\nSuperior Capital Efficiency and Speed: The ability to transfer liquidity across different blockchains in under 10 seconds is a major user benefit. This allows for quick and efficient movement of funds to capitalize on opportunities in different DeFi ecosystems with minimal delay and potentially lower slippage on trades. This is faster than most CEX withdrawals and traditional bridges.\nBenefits for Metis Ecosystem\nA Simple, Native, and Interest-Bearing Stablecoin to Fuel the Ecosystem:\nServe as a native stablecoin provider for Metis\u2019s DeFi ecosystems and build secure, reasonable yield scenarios to increase the Metis\u2019s TVL\n$muUSD can be used as margin for perpetual DEX trading, allowing users to meet both trading and yield needs at the same time\n$muUSD can be organically embedded into DeFi protocols to boost Metis\u2019s TVL\nRoadmap\nQ4 2025: Alpha Phase Expansion\nObjective: Enhance the Alpha launch and broaden ecosystem integration.\nKey Milestones:\nExpand supported chains beyond Ethereum, Linea, and Metis to include BNB Chain and X Layer.\nOptimize cross-chain liquidity transfers to achieve sub-5-second transaction times.\nStrengthen TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme) technology with more nodes for enhanced security and decentralization.\nQ1 2026: Beta Phase and DeFi Integration\nObjective: Transition to a public beta and establish $muUSD as a core stablecoin in DeFi ecosystems.\nKey Milestones:\nSupport additional stablecoins (e.g., USDT, USDG) for conversion to $muUSD.\nIntegrate $muUSD as margin for perpetual DEX trading on at least two major platforms.\nLaunch partnerships with emerging blockchains to serve as their native stablecoin provider.\nImplement automated liquidity rebalancing to minimize slippage across chains.\nConduct security audits for TSS consensus and cross-chain bridge contracts.\nQ2 2026: Mainnet Launch and Ecosystem Growth\nObjective: Achieve full mainnet deployment and drive ecosystem adoption.\nKey Milestones:\nFull mainnet launch (with TGE) with support for 10+ blockchains, including Solana and EVM chains.\nEnable $muUSD staking for additional yield opportunities (targeting 7-10% APY).\nEstablish Mullex as a liquidity middle layer for at least five public blockchains with muUSD.\nIntroduce governance features for $muUSD holders to vote on protocol upgrades.\nExpand TVL by integrating with major DeFi protocols (e.g., lending platforms, AMMs).\nQ3 2026: Scalability and Global Reach\nObjective: Scale infrastructure and expand Mullex\u2019s global presence.\nKey Milestones:\nOptimize TSS consensus for handling 100,000+ daily transactions.\nSupport cross-chain bridging for non-EVM chains (e.g., Polkadot, Cosmos).\nLaunch $muUSD as a native stablecoin for at least three new public blockchains.\nPartner with centralized exchanges to list $muUSD for broader accessibility.\nDevelop mobile app for Mullex bridge to enhance user access.\nQ4 2026 and Beyond: Maturity and Innovation\nObjective: Solidify Mullex as a leading liquidity layer and innovate new features.\nKey Milestones:\nIntroduce advanced yield farming strategies for $muUSD with risk-adjusted returns.\nExpand to 20+ blockchains, covering major EVM and non-EVM ecosystems.\nDevelop cross-chain derivatives trading using $muUSD as collateral.\nEstablish a decentralized governance council for long-term protocol sustainability.\nExplore integration with real-world asset (RWA) tokenization for diversified liquidity pools.\nSummary\nAn innovative decentralized unified liquidity layer designed to aggregate stablecoin liquidity across different chains and extend it to Metis.\nThank you for considering Mullex!\nOfficial Links: Website, Docs, etc\n-\n(https://x.com/MullexProtocol)\n- [Website](https://mullex.io/)\n- [Bridge App](https://www.mullex.io/bridge)\n- [Audits] (under security audit, no public report)"

        "content": "LazAI Data Query: Taking Control of Your AI Data\nby Danny Steffe | LazAI Dev Ambassador\nIn today\u2019s digital age, artificial intelligence interacts with vast amounts of personal and organizational data. While AI can provide amazing insights, the question remains: who really controls the data? Enter LazAI Data Query\u2014a tool designed to put data ownership back in the hands of the user.\nWhat Is LazAI Data Query?\nAt its core, LazAI Data Query is like a personal digital vault for your AI data. It allows you to query your own information\u2014to ask questions, generate insights, or run analyses\u2014without ever compromising your privacy. Unlike traditional systems where data is stored on centralized servers and controlled by third parties, LazAI ensures that you remain the sole owner of your data.\nHow It Works: Privacy and Security\nOne of the biggest concerns in AI today is privacy. Most AI applications rely on massive datasets, which often include sensitive personal information. LazAI Data Query addresses this by:\nSecure Access: Only the data owner can query their information. No one else can access it without permission.\nCryptographic Protection: Every query is verified using cryptography, ensuring that the data remains untampered.\nDecentralized Management: Data isn\u2019t stored in one central location. It leverages blockchain-based principles to maintain integrity, transparency, and security.\nThis approach ensures that your interactions with your data are safe, private, and trustworthy.\nVerifiable Access: Proof You Own Your Data\nOwnership in AI is more than just having a username and password. LazAI Data Query ensures that every interaction is verifiable. This means:\nYou can prove that your data hasn\u2019t been altered.\nYou can settle results on-chain, creating a permanent record of queries and outcomes.\nYou maintain full control over who can see or use your data.\nThis system is especially important for enterprises, developers, and researchers who rely on accurate, trustworthy data for AI applications.\nReal-World Benefits\nUsing LazAI Data Query brings multiple advantages:\nFull Data Ownership: You decide who gets access to your information.\nEnhanced Privacy: Sensitive information stays protected at all times.\nTransparent and Verifiable: Every query leaves a cryptographic record, ensuring accountability.\nIntegration-Ready: Works seamlessly with AI models, analytics tools, and Web3 infrastructures.\nReduced Risk: No third-party monopolization of your data.\nBy providing these benefits, LazAI empowers users to interact with AI safely, securely, and confidently.\nWhy It Matters\nIn a world where data drives AI, ownership and trust are key. LazAI Data Query gives users the ability to leverage the power of AI while keeping full control over their digital footprint. It\u2019s more than just a tool\u2014it\u2019s a data guardian, ensuring that your information is safe, verifiable, and truly yours.\nConclusion\nLazAI Data Query is a game-changer in the AI space. It bridges the gap between powerful AI capabilities and data privacy, security, and ownership. Whether you\u2019re an individual, developer, or enterprise, it allows you to ask questions, gain insights, and interact with your data safely.\n@LazAI",

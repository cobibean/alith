Most trading intelligence is centralized, opaque, and inaccessible to non-technical users. As a result, DeFi users frequently miss profitable opportunities or fall prey to volatility, lacking real-time, trustable AI-driven decision support.\nSolution Overview\nHyperMind AI transforms DeFi trading by delivering real-time, AI-generated trading signals directly within a web-based dashboard. Leveraging the Alith AI engine and Hyperion\u2019s AI-native blockchain infrastructure, it offers actionable insights such as BUY, HOLD, MONITOR, or YIELD FARM signals with confidence metrics, risk levels, and expected returns. The system simulates local inference for now, preparing for verifiable on-chain execution. It empowers users of all levels to trade smarter, safer, and faster using intelligence previously only available to professionals.\nProject Description\nHyperMind AI is a real-time DeFi trading assistant that simulates on-chain AI trading intelligence using AlithMock, a local inference engine designed to mirror the behavior of Alith AI. It displays AI signals based on multi-layer neural simulations, tracking entry/exit prices, confidence levels, and risk metrics.

Most trading intelligence is centralized, opaque, and inaccessible to non-technical users. As a result, DeFi users frequently miss profitable opportunities or fall prey to volatility, lacking real-time, trustable AI-driven decision support.\nSolution Overview\nHyperMind AI transforms DeFi trading by delivering real-time, AI-generated trading signals directly within a web-based dashboard. Leveraging the Alith AI engine and Hyperion\u2019s AI-native blockchain infrastructure, it offers actionable insights such as BUY, HOLD, MONITOR, or YIELD FARM signals with confidence metrics, risk levels, and expected returns. The system simulates local inference for now, preparing for verifiable on-chain execution. It empowers users of all levels to trade smarter, safer, and faster using intelligence previously only available to professionals.\nProject Description\nHyperMind AI is a real-time DeFi trading assistant that simulates on-chain AI trading intelligence using AlithMock, a local inference engine designed to mirror the behavior of Alith AI. It displays AI signals based on multi-layer neural simulations, tracking entry/exit prices, confidence levels, and risk metrics. Users can interact with a responsive dashboard, execute or monitor trades, and analyze their portfolio in real time.\n\nCore Features:\nAI Signal Feed: Real-time BUY / STRONG BUY / MONITOR / HOLD signals\nConfidence Scores: Up to 98%, updated live\nAlith System Stats: Neural processing speed, win rate, network uptime\nPortfolio Insights: Asset breakdown, daily P&L, Sharpe ratio, AI win rate\nExecution Panel: Run simulated signal execution logic with wallet connection\nEmergency Stop / Auto-Rebalance: Simulated protection features\nTechnologies:\nFrontend: JavaScript + ethers.js\nSmart Contract-ready: Solidity architecture (WIP)\nBackend (simulated): AlithMock inference engine (browser-based)\nChain: Hyperion / Alt-Hyperion Testnet\nUsers can connect a wallet, interact with live signals, monitor returns, and experience AI-assisted DeFi trading with one click.

Students and educators face the challenge of a rigid system that doesn\u2019t adapt to diverse needs, impacting learning outcomes.\nSolution Overview\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform offers a dynamic solution by employing a multi-agent system built on the Alith Agentic Framework. Specialized AI agents collaboratively analyze individual learning styles, curate tailored content, provide adaptive tutoring, and track progress in real time. This creates a uniquely personalized learning journey that adjusts to each student\u2019s needs and pace. By integrating diverse educational resources, the platform aims to enhance engagement, improve learning outcomes, and empower both students and educators.\nProject Description\nThis platform is designed to benefit a wide range of users across the educational landscape. Students of all ages, from kindergarten through higher education, can experience a more engaging and effective learning journey tailored to their specific needs.

These challenges slow down innovation and create barriers for onboarding new builders and users alike. In the Hyperion ecosystem, this fragmentation is especially pressing due to the early-stage nature of the tools and lack of seamless connectivity with other networks like Andromeda.\nSolution Overview\nHyperKit is a comprehensive infrastructure toolkit designed to simplify development and enhance interoperability within the Hyperion ecosystem. It combines core DeFi primitives, developer-centric APIs, and a robust bridging framework using the Metis SDK to enable seamless interactions between Hyperion and Andromeda. Our approach focuses on modularity, developer experience, and community-driven extensibility. By packaging essential tools into one unified kit, we aim to lower the entry barrier for developers and foster faster ecosystem growth.\nProject Description\nHyperKit is an open-source, developer-first infrastructure suite tailored for the Hyperion ecosystem. It provides a modular set of libraries and smart contracts that reimagine core DeFi building blocks (e.g., staking, swapping, vaults) optimized for Hyperion. Additionally, HyperKit includes a Web3 toolkit with prebuilt components such as wallet integrations, SDKs for dApp interactions, and templates for rapid deployment.\nA key component of HyperKit is its native interoperability layer powered by the Metis SDK. This allows developers to easily bridge assets and data between Hyperion and Andromeda, enabling truly cross-chain dApps.\nWe envision developers interacting with HyperKit via a CLI tool, SDKs in TypeScript and Rust, and a visual dashboard for managing deployments. By simplifying infrastructure access and providing composable building blocks, we empower developers to go from idea to deployment faster.\nWhat excites us most is the potential to accelerate the adoption of Hyperion by offering an experience comparable to mature ecosystems like Ethereum or Solana, but with the added benefit of native cross-chain capabilities.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nTo foster community engagement and drive adoption, HyperKit includes a gamified user testing program:\nTestable Features/Tasks:\n- Deploy a sample dApp using the HyperKit CLI.\n- Bridge test tokens from Hyperion to Andromeda using the Metis SDK.\n- Implement a staking pool using HyperKit contracts.\n- Submit feedback or a pull request to the open-source repo.\nPoints System:\n- 50 points \u2013 Deploy a test dApp\n- 30 points \u2013 Successfully bridge tokens\n- 20 points \u2013 Set up a staking pool\n- 10 points \u2013 Submit feedback or PR\nGamification Strategy:\nUsers accumulate points for completing tasks, which will be displayed on a leaderboard. Top contributors will be eligible for community badges, early adopter NFTs, and potential ecosystem grants.\nUser Onboarding Incentive:\nThis approach not only incentivizes users to explore and test HyperKit, but also creates a sense of achievement and progression. By engaging directly with the toolkit, users become more likely to contribute, build, and evangelize the Hyperion ecosystem.\nUpdate: Hyperion Testnet Deployment & Verified Contracts\nWe are excited to announce that the **Hyperion Testnet is now deployed and all critical contracts have been verified**. This milestone enables developers and users to fully interact with the HyperKit infrastructure on a live test environment.\nToken Contracts\n| Token | Symbol | Address | Verification Link |\n|-----------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Tether USD | USDT | `0x9b52D326D4866055F6c23297656002992e4293FC` | Verified on [Hyperion Testnet Explorer]( Metis Hyperion Testnet address details for 0x9b52D326D4866055F6c23297656002992e4293FC | Blockscout ) |\n| USD Coin | USDC | `0x31424DB0B7a929283C394b4DA412253Ab6D61682` | Verified on [Hyperion Testnet Explorer]( Metis Hyperion Testnet address details for 0x31424DB0B7a929283C394b4DA412253Ab6D61682 | Blockscout ) |\n| Dai Stablecoin | DAI | `0xdE896235F5897EC6D13Aa5b43964F9d2d34D82Fb` | Verified on [Hyperion Testnet Explorer]( Metis Hyperion Testnet address details for 0xdE896235F5897EC6D13Aa5b43964F9d2d34D82Fb | Blockscout ) |\n| Wrapped Ether | WETH | `0xc8BB7DB0a07d2146437cc20e1f3a133474546dD4` | Verified on [Hyperion Testnet Explorer]( Metis Hyperion Testnet address details for 0xc8BB7DB0a07d2146437cc20e1f3a133474546dD4 | Blockscout ) |\nContract Addresses and Types\n| Contract | Type | Address | Verification Link |\n|-----------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| LiquidityPool | AMM/Swap | `0x91C39DAA7617C5188d0427Fc82e4006803772B74` | Verified on [Hyperion Testnet Explorer]( Metis Hyperion Testnet address details for 0x91C39DAA7617C5188d0427Fc82e4006803772B74 | Blockscout ) |\n| BuyVault | Direct Purchase | `0x0adFd197aAbbC194e8790041290Be57F18d576a3` | Verified on [Hyperion Testnet Explorer]( Metis Hyperion Testnet address details for 0x0adFd197aAbbC194e8790041290Be57F18d576a3 | Blockscout ) |\n| StakingRewards | Staking | `0xB94d264074571A5099C458f74b526d1e4EE0314B` | Verified on [Hyperion Testnet Explorer]( Metis Hyperion Testnet address details for 0xB94d264074571A5099C458f74b526d1e4EE0314B | Blockscout ) |\n| Bridge | Cross-Chain | `0xfF064Fd496256e84b68dAE2509eDA84a3c235550` | Verified on [Hyperion Testnet Explorer]( Metis Hyperion Testnet address details for 0xfF064Fd496256e84b68dAE2509eDA84a3c235550 | Blockscout ) |\n| Faucet | Token Distribution| `0xE1B8C7168B0c48157A5e4B80649C5a1b83bF4cC4` | Verified on [Hyperion Testnet Explorer]( Metis Hyperion Testnet address details for 0xE1B8C7168B0c48157A5e4B80649C5a1b83bF4cC4 | Blockscout ) |\nUseful Resources & Links\n- [Testnet Walkthrough Video](https://x.com/HyperionKit/status/1957796051467001874)\n- [Guides Walkthrough Video](https://x.com/HyperionKit/status/1958525753974538332)\n- [Pitch Deck](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGvFBK3My0/YzvwHA4KNaQ4wwZvXVzpDQ/edit?utm_content=DAGvFBK3My0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)\n[Video Presentation](https://x.com/HyperionKit/status/1958552729376456781)\n- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HyperionKit/Hyperkit.git)\nMarketing Update\nA big thank you to the community and contributors: @Norbert, @Sheyda, @han, and @0xthiru for pushing us into the marketing challenge.\nAfter receiving our $300 kickstart fund on July 30th and additional sponsorship, we have launched a marketing campaign with a $100 budget based on our marketing plan, achieving the following:\nImpressions: 3.3K+\nNew followers on X (formerly Twitter): 54\nPosts: 6\nReplies: 4\nVerified followers: 5 / 132\nEngagement rate: 26.2%\nEngagements: 868\nProfile visits: 112\nLikes: 166\nReposts: 130\nBookmarks: 6\nShares: 2\n--\nNext Steps & Vision\nWe continue to improve the core functionality, focusing on product monetization strategies, expanding interoperability features, and enhancing the developer and user experience.

        "content": "RugRadar: AI Due Diligence Scoring on Hyperion\nYour shield against scams & rugpools on Metis Hyperion\nProblem we\u2019re targeting:\nNearly one-in-two new EVM tokens today is linked to a rug-pull pattern, draining roughly USD 800 million from retail wallets every year (and that figure excludes protocol hacks and exploits), according to reports by Certic, Chainalysis & others. Blockchain watchdogs estimate 117 000+ scam tokens going live every year, impacting \u2248 2 million investors worldwide.\nThese numbers keep growing because anyone can launch a token, bypass real due diligence, and disappear with the money. Trust and user growth in Metis, and across all L2 ecosystems, will always be at risk as long as there is no fast, reliable, and transparent way for the average user to verify a project before investing.\nSolution Overview\nAlphaMind RugRadar is an open-source, on-chain AI scoring agent that analyses token projects in real time, anchors its findings to LazAI DATs, and exposes a transparent risk score before funds change hands.\nBuilt with Alith SDK and executed on Hyperion\u2019s AI-optimised roll-up, it delivers an open, explainable trust layer that:\nFlags suspicious launches instantly, protecting retail community.\nIncentivises reputable teams to address red-flags pre-IDO/pre-TGE.\nGenerates on-chain gas, feeding Metis Builder-Mining rewards and TVL.\nThis means an average user on Metis could instantly verify a project\u2019s risk before investing, preventing potential rug-pulls and fostering trust.\nBy making due diligence simple and accessible, we help both users, ecosystems and launchpads spot scams early and bring more trust to the ecosystem. This innovation not only protects users, but will also incentivize higher-quality project onboarding, filter applications for ecosystem grants and increase the attractiveness of Metis as a launch destination.\nOur agent is designed to get smarter and better over time, learning from new data and community feedback. RugRadar will be a flagship example of Hyperion\u2019s AI capabilities, proving that complex AI agents can run on-chain at L2 speeds and deliver value to the community.\nProject Description\nCore functionality: The agent ingests white-papers, GitHub commits, byte-code, tokenomics and social patterns, runs an LLM-driven rule-engine (Alith) plus anomaly heuristics, then mints a DAT-anchored report with a 0-100 risk score visible on chain & via UI/bot.\n\nRugRadar on Hyperion: process from project submission to on-chain report\nEach report is published as a DAT on Hyperion, so it\u2019s tamper-proof and easy to check by anyone.\nAutomated, explainable scoring: Real-time, explainable risk scores with transparent audit logs, viewable on-chain and through an intuitive UI.\nMulti-source intelligence: Integrates on-chain analytics, cross-references external data (e.g., audit reports, GitHub activity), and flags suspicious or non-transparent elements.\nCommunity signals: Allows user-submitted reviews, crowd-sourced data points, and historical feedback to improve the agent\u2019s accuracy.\nContinuous learning: The AI agent continuously updates its heuristics using feedback loops and on-chain data, improving detection over time.\nSimple web interface at launch, with a Telegram bot pilot for fast alerts and feedback (off-chain interaction, on-chain data access)\nTechnologies & Approach:\nAlith SDK: For natural language understanding, reasoning, and explainability.\nHyperion L2 infrastructure: For ultra-fast, low-cost inference and public data availability.\nDecentralized Attestation Technology (DAT): To anchor due diligence reports and scoring provenance.\nUI/UX layer: Web and Telegram bot for seamless investor access.\nWhy we believe in this idea?\nBecause the future of Web3 relies on open, community-owned, and transparent systems, not black-box ratings controlled by corporations or pay-to-play platforms. The Metis ecosystem, with Hyperion and LazAI, is designed specifically to break this paradigm.\nToday, most rating and due diligence platforms operate with closed-source, unverifiable models and monetise ratings by selling \u201ctop\u201d listings to startups, creating conflicts of interest and undermining trust.\nWe believe every investor and builder deserves a system where the rules, data, and scoring logic are public and auditable.\nBy training RugRadar on real launchpad data, publishing our agent and scoring logic as open source, and inviting the community to help shape the rules, we create not just a tool, but a living, evolving knowledge base for the entire ecosystem.\nThis approach fits perfectly with Metis\u2019 vision for decentralized, on-chain AI: one where you can always verify the logic behind every score, where collective wisdom improves the model, and where no one can buy a good rating behind closed doors.\nBy making due diligence radically transparent, crowd-powered, and explainable, we enable a new standard of trust for Metis, Hyperion, and all of Web3.\nHow is RugRadar different from CertiK and DeFiSafety and other smart contract analyzer tools?\nRugRadar is fully open source and on-chain. Unlike CertiK and DeFiSafety, our scoring logic and reports are public, auditable, and can\u2019t be bought or changed behind closed doors. The model adapts through real community feedback, not just by a private team, and RugRadar will also learn how to analyze off-chain risks and social patterns, not just code.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nAnyone can submit a new project or token for review. All scoring actions require a Hyperion wallet, instantly onboarding new users to the Metis L2.\nUsers can leave feedback on scores, suggest changes, and flag errors\nSimple leaderboard for most active reviewers and contributors\nEach helpful action earns XP points (for leaderboard, beta rewards, or future airdrops)\nEarly contributors can earn NFT badges and get first access to advanced tools\nRegular \u201cSpot the Rug\u201d campaigns to test and improve the agent with real cases\nFeedback and community data directly help train and improve the AI, making RugRadar smarter for everyone\nWhy us?\nOur team brings years of experience in evaluating and supporting hundreds of Web3 projects through AlphaMind.co - a launchpad & web3 project discovery platform, and InnMind.com - the leading acceleration platform for early-stage web3 projects.\nWe\u2019ve seen thousands of projects, analyzed hundreds and launched dozens. We have insights into common scam tactics and real-world due diligence from both VC and retail perspective, that will directly shape RugRadar\u2019s AI scoring logic. We\u2019re not just theorists: we\u2019re launchpad builders who know the pain points from both sides.\nWithin 3 months, we plan to launch a beta on Hyperion testnet, integrate community feedback, and be ready for mainnet when Hyperion goes live.\nCommunity members can:\nJoin as testers: submit real token projects for scoring, review reports, and give feedback.\nSubmit project data or suspicious cases for AI review\nHelp curate and flag new scam patterns or contribute to the open-source rule library.\nPropose scoring rules or help us benchmark scam patterns\nAll code and scoring rules are open and auditable: fork it, run your own, or integrate it into other platforms.\nJoin ambassador program and help spread the word.\nWe\u2019d love your feedback! What risks matter most to you as a builder, investor, or user?\nComment below and help shape the next step in Web3 trust.",

        "content": "Problem Statement\nIn the rapidly growing Metis ecosystem, skilled freelancers such as developers, content writers, and other talents often struggle to find relevant paid opportunities, leading to underutilization of expertise and missed collaborations. Crypto and Web3 projects face challenges in sourcing reliable talent for short-term projects, resulting in delays and inefficiencies in project execution. This disconnect creates a fragmented marketplace where both parties experience barriers to efficient, direct engagement and fair compensation.\nSolution Overview\nHyper Devs addresses this by creating a dedicated marketplace platform that connects freelancers with bounties and gigs posted by Metis ecosystem projects, streamlining the process of matching skills to needs. An AI agent decomposes complex project goals into multiple manageable bounties, making it easier for companies to list tasks based on their project goals and for individuals to apply and get paid in cryptocurrency upon completion.\nProject Description\nHyper Devs is a user-friendly platform built on the Metis blockchain, serving as a specialized freelance marketplace for the crypto and Web3 space. At its core, the platform allows companies and projects to submit high-level goals, which an integrated AI agent automatically breaks down into well-defined bounties or gigs. These listings include details like required skills, deadlines, and cryptocurrency rewards.\nFreelancers can browse, filter, and apply to these opportunities via a dashboard, submit work for review, and receive instant payments upon approval through the agent, ensuring trust and transparency. The AI agent leverages LLM models for natural language processing to decompose tasks intelligently.\nUsers interact by creating profiles\u2014freelancers showcase portfolios and skills, while companies post and manage bounties. Benefits include faster talent acquisition for projects, diverse income streams for individuals, and a vibrant ecosystem that encourages more rapid innovation in Metis.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nTo gamify the platform and boost user onboarding, Hyper Devs will include testable features and tasks that reward users with points, redeemable for perks like priority bounty access, exclusive NFTs, or bonus cryptocurrency payouts.\nTestable Features/Tasks:\nCreating a profile (e.g., uploading skills and portfolio)\nBrowsing and applying to sample bounties\nSubmitting mock work for a demo gig\nReviewing and approving submissions (for project owner simulations)\nParticipating in community forums to provide feedback on platform usability\nPoints System:\n50 points for profile setup\n100 points for applying to a bounty\n200 points for completing a mock submission\n150 points bonus for referring new users\nPoints accumulate in a user dashboard with tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold) unlocking escalating rewards\nHow This Gamifies the Experience:\nBy turning onboarding and testing into a points-based game with leaderboards, achievements, and progress trackers, it creates a fun, competitive environment that motivates users to explore and engage deeply, similar to RPG-style progression.\nHow This Encourages User Onboarding:\nNew users are drawn in by low-barrier entry tasks that provide immediate rewards, fostering habit formation and word-of-mouth sharing. This viral loop helps build a large, active community quickly, ensuring the platform\u2019s marketplace thrives with diverse participants from day one.\nGetting Involved\nInterested community members can join Hyper Devs telegram at: Telegram: View @hyperdevsmetis",

Manual trading is emotionally taxing, requires constant market monitoring, and demands technical analysis skills many users lack. Additionally, traders struggle to maintain consistent strategies, often shifting approaches based on emotion rather than data, leading to suboptimal results.\nSolution Overview\nLazaiTrader is an intelligent multi-agent trading system accessible through Telegram that allows users to select specialized AI trading personas, each with distinct strategies and risk profiles. The system continuously analyzes market conditions and either generates actionable buy/sell signals or automatically executes trades across major DEXs based on user preference.\nBuilt on the same robust Alith framework infrastructure and a privacy-preserving Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), LazaiTrader adapts to market conditions while maintaining the user\u2019s selected trading philosophy, effectively bringing institutional-grade trading strategies to retail users through a familiar messaging interface.\nThrough deep integration with the Lazai Network, users can securely contribute their private trading data and configurations, which are stored in a TEE and become part of a collective knowledge base. The system then provides personalized analysis and recommendations by comparing user performance against this anonymized collective data, ensuring privacy while delivering data-backed insights that improve trading outcomes for the entire community.\nProject Description\nLazaiTrader transforms crypto trading by allowing users to select from various AI trading personas, each representing different trading philosophies and strategies. Whether you prefer momentum trading, swing trading, technical analysis, or contrarian approaches, LazaiTrader provides a suite of specialized AI agents to match your preferred style.\nCore Features\nPersona Selection System: Allows users to choose trading philosophies that match their temperament\nStrategy Visualization: Shows potential entry/exit points before execution\nDual-Mode Operation: Offers either signal-only notifications or fully automated trade execution\nStrategy Vault: Securely analyzes trading data with AI to offer personalized crypto strategy improvement suggestions.\nThe system leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) technology and a decentralized Strategy Vault, enabled by the Lazai network, to maintain a coherent understanding across interactions, remembering user preferences, portfolio composition, and past decisions.\nTrading Infrastructure\nThe platform is currently optimized for agentic trading on our own custom-built DEX with a private oracle solution. On production, we will enable trading on HerculesDEX to provide access to its deep liquidity on Metis. Our future roadmap includes a direct integration with Binance, which is ready for deployment but will be released later to allow for a more elaborate user onboarding process.\nAdvanced Trading Algorithms\nOur algorithms move beyond traditional indicators like moving averages which might not be as reliable in volatile crypto markets. Instead, we use:\nMomentum-based strategies that capitalize on emerging trends before they become obvious\nVolatility-adaptive approaches that dynamically adjust position sizes based on market conditions\nLiquidity flow analysis to identify smart money movements before price reacts\nTrading Personas\nUsers can select specific asset-focused strategies including:\nBlue Chip Trader: Focusing on BTC, ETH, METIS and other established cryptocurrencies\nMicro Cap Trader: For those seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in emerging tokens\nEach persona combines these strategy elements differently based on their trading philosophy.\nUser Experience\nUsers interact with the system through a telegram interface that explains complex trading strategies in accessible terms tailored to each user\u2019s demonstrated technical understanding. What makes LazaiTrader particularly valuable is its recognition that bull markets favor active trading strategies rather than passive yield farming approaches, allowing users to capitalize on market momentum through their preferred trading style.\nStrategy Vault\nA new feature, the \u201cStrategy Vault,\u201d allows users to securely contribute their trading data and configuration. This data, signed with the user\u2019s wallet and stored in a TEE on the Lazai network, becomes part of a collective knowledge base.

This is not just another testnet launch \u2014 it\u2019s the start of a new type of economy where data, AI models, and user contributions are no longer trapped in closed systems, but recognised, verifiable, and rewarded on-chain.\nWhy This Launch Matters\nFor years, AI has faced the same roadblocks:\nData locked away in silos with no fair way to share or monetise it.\nNo trusted mechanism to prove the quality or integrity of data and models.\nIncentives that favour big players, leaving smaller builders and contributors out of the value flow.\nLazAI introduces a different approach. With Data Anchoring Tokens (DATs), anyone can turn their data or model into a verifiable asset. This means contributors finally have transparency and ownership, while builders can rely on higher-quality, provable inputs.\nWhat\u2019s Available on Testnet\nHere\u2019s what you can already explore:\nAlith SDKs: Tools in Python, Node.js, and Rust that let developers build AI agents and plug them directly into the blockchain environment. Even if you\u2019re not highly technical, this means the foundation is ready for experimentation.\nDATs (Data Anchoring Tokens): A new standard that proves your contribution has value, anchors it on-chain, and allows you to earn from usage.\nLazbubu Companion DATs: Interactive AI agents that evolve as you engage with them.

The iDAO (Individual DAO) model ensures each AI agent and its assets can be governed closer to the community that shapes it, rather than being lost in massive, slow-moving DAOs. This is an experiment in keeping decision-making transparent, accountable, and fair.\nWhy You Should Get Involved\nBuilders can try out the SDKs and start experimenting with new types of AI agents.\nData contributors finally have a way to prove and monetise their input.\nCommunity members can join the whitelist and be among the first to mint and \u201craise\u201d a Lazbubu Companion DAT, unlocking early rewards.\nEveryone gets a chance to shape and stress-test what a decentralised AI economy might look like.\nLet\u2019s Talk\nThe LazAI Testnet isn\u2019t just about testing the tech. It\u2019s about testing the idea of a fair, open AI economy. This only works if builders, contributors, and communities push it together.\nSome questions for the community:\nWhat kind of agents would you like to see built first?\nHow do you see DATs fitting into real projects outside of LazAI?\nShould we organise community-led stress tests or share our first DAT experiments here on the forum?\nFull details: LazAI Testnet is Live \u2014 The AI Economy Starts Here",

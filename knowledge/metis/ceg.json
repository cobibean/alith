        "content": "Metis Andromeda Network Update: DA Migration & Fraud Proofs\nDear Metis Community,\nWe would like to provide an update on two key upgrades to the Metis Andromeda network: Fraud Proofs and Data Availability (DA) migration to Ethereum 4844 blobs. These upgrades are now live on the Metis Sepolia testnet and are undergoing testing. Pending successful evaluation, we plan to deploy them to Andromeda Mainnet after the Ethereum Pectra upgrade on March 27th.\nThese upgrades enhance network security, decentralization, and trustlessness by providing a permissionless mechanism to challenge invalid transactions and ensuring that all transaction data is available on Ethereum for independent verification.\nKey Changes\n1. Data Availability (DA) Migration to Ethereum L1 4844 Blobs\nBackground\nData availability is a fundamental requirement for rollups, ensuring that all transaction data is accessible for verification by network participants. When transactions are processed on Metis, their data must be stored in a way that allows anyone to reconstruct the network state independently.\nPreviously, Metis used MEMO Labs as its DA provider, offering an off-chain storage solution that reduced costs while maintaining scalability. However, with the introduction of Ethereum EIP-4844 blobs, we now have the opportunity to migrate our DA layer to Ethereum L1 and inherit its security guarantees.\nWhy Migrate to Ethereum 4844 Blobs?\nThe primary reason for this migration is to inherit Ethereum\u2019s security model, ensuring that Metis transactions remain verifiable and immutable within Ethereum\u2019s consensus framework. While the cost of using Ethereum blobs is slightly higher than using MEMO Labs, the difference is negligible and will not impact transaction fees on Metis.\nBy migrating to Ethereum\u2019s native DA storage, Metis strengthens the integrity and auditability of its transactions without introducing significant overhead costs. This move also formally designates Metis as a Stage 0 Rollup, ensuring that all transaction data is published on Ethereum for maximum transparency and reliability.\n2. Fraud Proofs & Enhanced Security Mechanisms\nIntroduction to Fraud Proofs\nFraud proofs introduce a verification mechanism that enables anyone to challenge invalid state transitions on the network. This ensures that only valid transactions are finalized, removing the need to trust any single entity.\nHow Fraud Proofs Work\nFraud proofs allow network participants to challenge invalid state roots submitted by sequencers. The process works as follows:\nState Submission: Sequencers submit state updates to Ethereum, assuming they are correct unless proven otherwise.\nChallenge Window: A dispute period allows anyone to challenge an invalid state.\nDispute Resolution: If a challenge is raised, the network verifies whether the state transition was correct. If the challenge is successful, the invalid state submission is rejected, and the responsible sequencer is penalized.\nThis system ensures that fraudulent transactions cannot be finalized, maintaining the integrity of the rollup without requiring centralized oversight.\nHow This Enhances Trustlessness\nPermissionless Challenges: Any participant can dispute an invalid state, ensuring that only valid transactions are finalized.\nIndependent Withdrawal Verification: Users can withdraw funds without needing to trust the operator, as transactions are independently verifiable on Ethereum.\nThis upgrade brings Metis closer to a Stage 1 Rollup, further reducing trust assumptions and enhancing the network\u2019s decentralization.\n3. Sequencer Slashing & Security Enhancements\nSlashing & Removal: If a sequencer submits an invalid state (e.g., incorrect transaction data or an invalid state root), they will be slashed and removed from the sequencer pool. This discourages malicious behavior and reinforces the integrity of the system.\nSelf-Sequencing Plans: Future upgrades will introduce self-sequencing, allowing users to propose their own transactions. This ensures that users retain control over their transactions, even in cases of sequencer failure or network congestion.\nNext Steps & Timeline\nMainnet Deployment: These upgrades will be rolled out to Andromeda Mainnet after Ethereum\u2019s Pectra upgrade on March 27th.\nOngoing Security & Decentralization Improvements: Additional enhancements will continue to improve Metis\u2019 security, scalability, and trustless execution environment.\nThese upgrades mark an important step in improving Metis\u2019 security and decentralization, providing users with a more robust, verifiable, and independent Layer 2 experience.",

                "comment": "I generally like this kind of voting structure when consensus is the goal (100% agreement). However, consensus (100% agreement) is not the decision-making goal here.\nSo my main concern is that one individual who holds more than 5000 METIS can block any vote, or a small group of 2-3 ppl who have a combined 5000 METIS can block any proposal and continuously disrupt governance for selfish reasons.\nMaybe adding a wallets quorum could mitigate concentrated influence.\nEx: 5000 METIS + 25 wallets AGAINST"

                "comment": "I agree with your concern that a single individual or a small group holding 5000 METIS could disrupt governance and block proposals for personal gain. Adding a wallet quorum, such as requiring 5000 METIS plus a minimum number of distinct wallets against a proposal, could help mitigate concentrated influence.\nAnother potential solution could be implementing a voting power cap per wallet to prevent any single entity from having disproportionate control. For example, even if someone holds more than 5000 METIS, their voting power could be capped at a certain threshold, ensuring that governance remains more decentralized.\nThis is definitely something that should be carefully thought through to maintain a fair and balanced decision-making process."

Through this lens, Gitcoin Passport emerges as the most promising solution.\n\u2013 Gitcoin Passport aggregates multiple identity attestations from trusted Web2 and Web3 platforms (Twitter, Github, BrightID, ENS domains), offering familiarity and broad accessibility.\n\u2013 It\u2019s already successfully integrated in Gitcoin\u2019s funding rounds, ensuring real-world usability and some Sybil resistance.\nRecommendation:\nStart with Gitcoin Passport, possibly augmented by BrightID, due to established user trust, ease of integration, and minimal friction, facilitating higher initial adoption rates.\nWhat privacy vs. accessibility balance do you prefer?\n\u2013 A balance like Gitcoin Passport strikes an appealing middle ground, offering sufficient privacy (users don\u2019t disclose overly sensitive details) while remaining extremely easy and familiar, encouraging broad initial participation.\n\u2013 If privacy concerns later become significant in the Metis community, progressively integrating more privacy-centric solutions (like zkPass or zero-knowledge identity proofs) could be introduced once participation and comfort levels are established.\nHow important is the integration of reputation scoring in our PoP solution?\n\u2013 Integrating reputation scoring is highly valuable and should be seriously considered, especially given your focus on sustained, meaningful engagement. Reputation scoring, as offered by protocols like Nomis/0xScore, incentivizes not just participation but also the quality of governance contributions. It aligns incentives, discouraging superficial or exploitative voting (like airdrop farmers) by weighting contributions based on reputation metrics.\n\u2013 However, reputation scoring systems also introduce complexity and may initially lower accessibility. A balanced approach is advisable:\nInitially, implement simple PoP (Gitcoin Passport) to establish baseline trust and user comfort.\nLater, once initial identity verification is normalized, layer in reputation systems like Nomis/0xScore to reward high-quality, consistent governance participation explicitly. This progressive approach ensures engagement grows organically without overwhelming users upfront."

        "content": "In this fast-paced and ever-changing Web3 landscape, we find ourselves at a pivotal moment in history. Past achievements no longer guarantee future success. The stagnation of Ethereum, the conclusion of Web3\u2019s social experiment, and evolving user behaviors serve as clear reminders of a harsh reality: without proactive innovation, obsolescence is inevitable.\nAt Metis, we have never been content to be just another Layer 2. We are disruptors\u2014visionaries bold enough to take action, not only to revitalize the Ethereum ecosystem but also to shape the future of humanity in the Web3 and AI era. Our ReGenesis initiative is far more than an upgrade - it is a renaissance for the blockchain ecosystem.\nPart I: Why Metis Initiated ReGenesis\n1. The Stagnation of Ethereum and the End of Web3\u2019s Social Experiment\nReflecting on this cycle, Ethereum\u2019s performance has been underwhelming. This stagnation has not only hindered Ethereum\u2019s growth but has also sent shockwaves across its broader ecosystem, particularly affecting the Layer 2 solutions built upon it.\nThe root cause of Ethereum\u2019s underperformance lies in the conclusion of Web3\u2019s social experiment. Ethereum has struggled to adapt to the evolving market landscape, signaling a critical need for transformation.\nThe end of Web3\u2019s social experiment is most evident in two key areas:\nDeFi\u2019s Innovation Bottleneck\nDeFi, the cornerstone of the previous cycle has successfully completed its foundational theoretical validation. The industry now has a comprehensive understanding of its core principles. Without disruptive innovations however, DeFi\u2019s growth has stagnated, leading to diminished enthusiasm from both investors and users.\nShifting User Behaviors\nAs users gain a deeper understanding of the industry and face the uncertainties of volatile markets, their focus has shifted from long-term visions to short-term profit maximization. Priorities have moved toward capital efficiency, opportunity costs, and immediate returns, while the idealism of decentralization has taken a backseat.\nIn this context, Ethereum should have adapted its strategy to align with market dynamics, placing greater emphasis on ecosystem applications that provide tangible value to users. However, it has prioritized technological innovation and the pursuit of decentralized ideals, overlooking the market\u2019s growing demand for a more efficient, cost-effective ecosystem that drives wealth creation.\n2. Ethereum vs. Solana & Base: Different Strategies, Different Outcomes\nThe winners of this cycle are Solana and Base, not Ethereum. These chains adopted fundamentally different strategies:\nSolana: By prioritizing extreme performance over decentralization, Solana delivered low gas fees and high-speed transactions, becoming a hotspot for NFTs, DeFi, and even the meme culture. By encouraging developers and users to create \u201cfun and wealth-generating\u201d use cases, Solana successfully drove both user growth and capital accumulation.\nBase: Leveraging Coinbase\u2019s ecosystem for seamless user acquisition, Base created a low-barrier, highly active on-chain experience. Through the combination of meme culture and low gas fees, it quickly became a favorite for new users. Here, decentralization took a backseat as users prioritized opportunities to \u201cmake money\u201d and enjoy engaging, accessible experiences.\nIn contrast, Ethereum has lagged in these areas. While it remains the world\u2019s most decentralized and secure programmable blockchain, today\u2019s users prioritize lower transaction costs, better user experiences, and compelling applications. As a result, Ethereum has faced mounting criticism, while Solana and Base have captured the spotlight.\n3. Why Metis, as a Layer 2, Must Take Action\nMetis has never been a traditional \u201cEthereum Layer 2.\u201d From the very beginning, we set ourselves apart through innovation and a forward-thinking approach. A look back at our journey highlights how Metis has consistently been a trailblazer, not merely following in Ethereum\u2019s footsteps:\nThe First Layer 2 to Propose DAO-Centric Governance\nMetis embraced the MetisDAO identity from the start, reflecting our conviction that DAOs\u2014and their evolution into DACs\u2014are central to blockchain\u2019s future. Unlike many early Layer 2s that prioritized performance over decentralization, we\u2019ve pursued an effective balance of scalability, agility, and community-driven governance. This positions us to proactively shape the evolving Web3 landscape.\nPioneering Off-Chain Data Availability in Layer 2\nWhen off-chain data availability (DA) faced skepticism for challenging traditional decentralization\u2014due to concerns like data withholding\u2014Metis boldly embraced it as a scalable solution. Our early adoption via Memo Labs showcased a vision for cost-efficient Layer 2 growth. Today, as off-chain DA gains traction alongside modular blockchain designs, Metis\u2019s foresight is affirmed, cementing our role as innovators in the evolving L2 landscape.\nPioneers in Cutting-Edge Technology\nMetis has been an early advocate of zero-knowledge proofs (ZK), investing in groundbreaking projects like ZKM and GOAT to push the boundaries of blockchain technology.\nThe Only Layer 2 to Launch a Decentralized Sequencer\nWhile decentralization is a core value of Ethereum, most Layer 2 solutions still rely on centralized sequencers. Metis stands alone as the only Layer 2 to have launched a decentralized sequencer, staying true to the foundational principles of blockchain.\nThese milestones demonstrate that Metis has never been a passive player in the market. We are active agents of change, consistently challenging the status quo. In this cycle, we refuse to remain silent. Once again, we will embrace our role as disruptors, driving the ReGenesis initiative to bring fresh perspectives and transformative directions to the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader blockchain industry.\n4. ReGenesis: A \u201cRebirth\u201d\nThe core objective of ReGenesis is to resolve the fundamental contradiction within today\u2019s blockchain ecosystem:\nOn one hand, Ethereum must uphold its technological leadership and decentralized foundation.\nOn the other hand, the ecosystem needs continuous innovation and growth to attract users and capital while fostering engaging and appealing applications.\nTo address this challenge, the ReGenesis initiative will advance along two key directions:\n1. Advanced Technological Research\nHigh-Performance Architecture: Develop cutting-edge architectures to support real-time, high-frequency applications and diverse development scenarios.\nBet on AI, incubating projects like LazAI to address the alignment of AI with human values.\n2. Building and Introducing Engaging Ecosystem Applications\nAI as a Growth Catalyst: AI represents a transformative growth opportunity for blockchain. It can enrich the ecosystem, attract new users, and bring vibrancy to Web3.\nInfrastructure for AI in Web3: Metis will provide robust infrastructure to support AI-driven applications, expanding blockchain\u2019s purpose beyond DeFi, NFTs, and memes. This will lay the foundation for an intelligent, dynamic new era.\nMetis refuses to follow fleeting market trends or passively watch as Ethereum stagnates during this cycle. Through the ReGenesis initiative, we are committed to breaking the status quo and uncovering new growth opportunities for the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader blockchain industry.\nMetis has always been a disruptor. Once again, we are stepping forward as pioneers of change, driving innovation and reshaping the future of Web3.\nPart II: What Is ReGenesis?\n1. ReGenesis\nReGenesis is not just a technical upgrade - it is a rebirth of Web3 in the AI era. Our mission is not only to revitalize the Ethereum ecosystem but also to empower Web3 with the tools needed to thrive in the age of AI, forging a groundbreaking economic model for AI + Web3.\nWe stand at a pivotal moment in technological evolution:\nTraditional AI is advancing rapidly but remains under the control of centralized tech giants. Data is locked in black boxes, algorithms are inaccessible, and individuals lack agency in shaping the future of AI.\nWeb3\u2019s AI development is falling far behind, unable to keep pace with real-world AI advancements. Current AI + Web3 solutions are largely limited to calling AI APIs, failing to integrate AI into Web3\u2019s core value system.\nIf Web3 does not actively embrace the AI era, it risks becoming obsolete\u2014reduced to nothing more than an irrelevant decentralization experiment. But we refuse to accept this future.\nReGenesis is committed to fully integrating AI and Web3, laying the foundation for:\nDecentralized data governance\nAI Assetization\nAn AI-driven intelligent economy\nMetis is not here to ride the AI + Web3 trend; we are here to define its rules and become the natural habitat for this new species of innovation.\n2. The Core Components of ReGenesis\n(1) Reshaping the Foundations of Web3\nAndromeda Network Upgrade + A New High-Performance Chain\nThis upgrade will redefine Metis as the optimal infrastructure for AI computation and data interaction.

In this process, mechanisms such as on-chain voting, consensus protocols, and privacy computing are employed to achieve data value confirmation and assetization, thereby facilitating AI data governance.\nLazAI, as the cornerstone of the ReGenesis initiative, introduces a groundbreaking framework for AI data governance and assetization:\niDAO (Individual-centric Decentralized Autonomous Organization) + DAT (Data AnchoringToken)\nThe value of AI training data will no longer be determined by centralized institutions but governed by the iDAO mechanism. This ensures that the generation and circulation of AI assets adhere to Web3\u2019s principles of fairness.\nDATs will serve as the representation of AI assets, anchoring data and AI-generated content to blockchain-based ownership. This will enable AI assets to circulate within the Web3 economic system.\nVerified Computing: A Value Assessment System for AI Assets\nA key challenge in AI assetization is how to measure value. The value of AI-generated content cannot rely on traditional centralized methods and requires the establishment of a decentralized verification mechanism.\nVerified Computing ensures that AI assets are verifiable on-chain, providing a reliable value assessment system. It guarantees that AI-generated content, data, and reasoning results can be fairly priced and supports the free trade of AI assets.\nThe value of AI assets will no longer be defined by a handful of tech companies but collectively determined by the Web3 ecosystem, creating a truly decentralized AI economic system.\nPoint of View Data: A New Paradigm for AI Training Data\nTraditional AI training data is primarily controlled by centralized institutions and dominated by a single perspective, resulting in significant biases and limitations in AI training.\nLazAI adopts a \u201cPoint of View Data\u201d system, enabling AI training data to encompass multiple dimensions, diverse perspectives, and various cultural backgrounds. This approach ensures that the content AI learns better reflects the complexity of the real world and aligns more closely with human societal values.\nUltimately, LazAI is more than just a decentralized AI training network\u2014it serves as the foundational infrastructure for AI assetization, data governance, value assessment, and economic systems. LazAI enables AI to fully \u201cintegrate\u201d into Web3, becoming an essential component of its economic ecosystem.\n(3) Realizing AI + Web3 Applications\nAlith: The AI Agent Framework\nAlith will act as a digital assistant for Web3 users, enabling AI agents to directly create value on-chain.\nAI-Native Application Incubation\nThrough the combination of LazAI and Alith, we will foster a new wave of AI-driven Web3 businesses, such as intelligent social networks, automated DeFi protocols, and on-chain AI economies.\nUltimately, ReGenesis isn\u2019t just about making AI \u201ccompatible\u201d with blockchain\u2014it\u2019s about empowering AI to establish its own independent survival mode within the Web3 ecosystem.\nWeb3 needs AI, and AI needs Web3.\n3. Why ReGenesis Is Unique\nWhile many blockchains are exploring the AI narrative, ReGenesis is the only initiative truly building an AI asset ecosystem. Its uniqueness lies in:\nNot just optimizing Layer 2 performance, but equipping Layer 2 with native AI computational capabilities.\nNot just supporting AI, but creating a complete survival environment for AI within Web3.\nLazAI decentralizes AI training data, ensuring alignment with human societal values.\nDAT enables the assetization of AI, seamlessly integrating it into the Web3 economy.\nVerified Computing makes AI asset value measurable, verifiable, and tradable.\nDecentralized Sequencers + Dual-Chain Architecture ensure that Web3 retains its decentralized ethos.\nMost current AI + Web3 solutions remain little more than \u201cWeb2 practices dressed in blockchain packaging.\u201d In contrast, ReGenesis is the first initiative to redefine the AI value system through true Web3 principles.\n4. How ReGenesis Drives Ecosystem Growth\nThe ReGenesis initiative will form a complete AI + Web3 flywheel:\nAndromeda + New Chain Architecture \u2192 A high-performance environment for AI computation and transactions.\nLazAI \u2192 Decentralized AI training data to ensure alignment with human values.\nDAT \u2192 Transforming AI assets into part of the Web3 economy, creating a new AI economic model.\nVerified Computing \u2192 Making AI asset value measurable, verifiable, and tradable.\nEnhancer and developer engagement \u2192 Establishing a self-sustaining growth cycle for AI + Web3.\nPart III: Why Should You Pay Attention and Join ReGenesis?\n1.

The approach of strengthening decentralized structures and accelerating scalable solutions is something I\u2019m particularly excited about, and I look forward to seeing its long-term impact on the Metis ecosystem.\nIt would be fascinating to explore in more detail how AI ReGenesis will integrate with Metis\u2019 Layer 2 infrastructure and which fundamental gaps it aims to fill within Ethereum\u2019s future. Additionally, understanding the roadmap for community growth, developer ecosystem expansion, and real-world adoption will be crucial.\nI\u2019m eager to continue contributing to the growth of the Metis ecosystem throughout this transformative journey. Together, let\u2019s keep shaping the future of decentralization!\nBest regards,\nHan- Metis Turkish Leader"

        "content": "Abstract\nThis proposal introduces Phase 1 of a structured upgrade to the CVP system, aimed at increasing participation, reducing Sybil influence, enhancing transparency, and improving resource allocation. The proposed changes include adjusting governance voting minimums, introducing batch voting, implementing a fast-track option, and launching structured outreach initiatives such as AI-generated project summaries and AMAs. These changes will make CVP voting more meaningful and scalable while setting the foundation for future improvements.\nAdditional discussion can be reviewed in the [Temp Check] CVP Upgrade Proposal.\nPurpose\nThe goal of this proposal is to align the CVP system with the long-term success of high-quality dApps launching on Metis by:\nIncreasing participation in CVP eligibility votes to boost community engagement and awareness.\nReducing Sybil votes to ensure governance reflects genuine community sentiment.\nImproving transparency and safety for Metis users researching new projects.\nOptimizing how marketing resources are allocated to maximize ecosystem impact.\nBackground\nThe current CVP system is a gatekeeping mechanism for projects requesting marketing support and resources from the Metis Foundation. However, several challenges have emerged:\nSybil attacks (fake wallets, low-value votes) distort results and artificially help projects reach quorum.\nGovernance fatigue is a growing issue, as tokenholders struggle to vet an increasing number of projects.\nUnclear expectations around marketing support have led to misconceptions that passing CVP automatically guarantees promotional backing from the Metis Foundation.\nThis proposal seeks to implement immediate improvements to address these issues while laying the groundwork for future enhancements.\nProposal\nPhase 1: Immediate Upgrades to the CVP System\nThe following structural and outreach changes will be implemented:\n1. Structural Changes\n1.1 Voting Minimums\nSet a minimum of 0.1 METIS to participate in CVP votes.\nReduce quorum from 500 to 400 unique wallets.\nUPDATE: Reduce Token Quorum from 10k METIS to 5k METIS, ONLY for CVP votes. All other voting types remain unchanged.\nRationale: This makes Sybil attacks more expensive while ensuring a low barrier for governance participation. A 0.1 METIS threshold ensures that voters have at least minimal alignment with the Metis ecosystem. Additionally, reducing token quorum for CVP votes only balances adjusting for market conditions with minimizing risk of capture and centralization.\n1.2 Batch Voting\nGroup votes into batches of 3\u20135 projects, held on a set schedule (e.g., monthly or bi-monthly).\nRationale: Reduces governance fatigue, making it easier for tokenholders to review projects in a structured manner.\n1.3 Fast-Track Option\nAllow projects to opt out of batch voting and outreach initiatives if they prefer an immediate vote.\nRationale: Provides flexibility for projects confident in their ability to meet quorum independently.\n2. Outreach Initiatives\n2.1 AI-Generated Podcast Summaries\nEach project in the eligibility vote batch will have an AI-generated podcast episode summarizing its key details.\nImplementation:\nProjects will submit relevant documentation (pitch decks, summaries).\nThe AI-generated podcast will be shared on Metis governance channels.\nRationale: This enables tokenholders to easily research projects without extensive manual effort.\n2.2 Project Showcases (AMAs & Shill Sessions)\nProjects will have structured opportunities to present to the community before votes are held.\nImplementation:\nLive AMAs/shill sessions will be scheduled before each batch vote.\nRecordings will be made available for asynchronous participation.\nRationale: Provides direct engagement between projects and the Metis community, increasing transparency and engagement.\n3. Marketing Resource Clarification\nClearly communicate that passing CVP makes a project eligible for marketing support but does not guarantee it.\nRationale: Ensures projects understand that marketing support is allocated based on strategic priorities rather than automatically granted.\nNext Steps & Future Considerations\nIf approved, these changes will be implemented immediately and monitored for effectiveness. The following conditions will determine readiness for future upgrades:\nVoting participation: Quorum (400 wallets, 5k METIS) is consistently met without additional interventions beyond the structured outreach initiatives.\nSybil mitigation: The percentage of Sybil votes falls below 10%.\nCommunity engagement: AMA participation and podcast listening rates indicate meaningful interaction.\nEffectiveness review: If the Phase 1 adjustments fail to produce the desired outcomes, the strategy will be revised before advancing to future phases.\nLonger-term enhancements such as tiered verification, community-led safety audits, and additional security features will be considered in subsequent phases but are not part of this proposal.\nConclusion\nThis proposal introduces structured, low-overhead governance improvements to increase participation, reduce Sybil votes, enhance transparency, and optimize marketing resource allocation. By implementing these immediate upgrades, the CVP system will become more scalable and aligned with the growth of high-quality projects in the Metis ecosystem.",

                "comment": "The way i see it is, voting mechanisms for Chains needs to based on actual engagement and activity of the chains community\nRegardless how many wallets and how much metis, if only 3k worth of Metis in users are participating then setting requirements of 10k doesnt make alot of sense\nAMA\u2019s campaigning etc only goes so far especially for a project thats new to Metis like us, and bribing people to vote doesn\u2019t make alot of sense either.\nThat\u2019s how onboarding becomes smoother and more effecient for a chain to grow\nAnd realistically new Metis projects won\u2019t know people with big wallets\nOr have large communities with Metis in wallets voting for them.\nThe current way if I\u2019m being honest doesn\u2019t really accomplish the goals I\u2019m sure you guys are trying to accomplish\nBasically a few whales can decide who\u2019s in and who\u2019s out, I mean for all we know maybe Metis itself is a whale and likes certain projects and votes for them etc\nSecond issue is it\u2019s way to dependant on market and peoples financial situation (how much $METIS they hold)\nAnd also way to dependant on a chains activity (Chain loses activity = harder for new projects to get votes = less growth for chain = a bad spiral effect) which is not sustainable for a chains growth and is not friendly for new projects looking to join Metis.\nSo what can be done short term?\nWell for starters, take a look at how much views and comments the average proposal from new projects get, study the correlation between the average votes a new project gets vs the market conditions at that time and if possible look at any relevant info to why some projects may have gotten more votes and others less, and be realistic when thinking of a the amount of Tokens should be voting for a project to get accepted.\nFrom what I have gathered from looking at the above that I mentioned, I can\u2019t see a new project like ourselves or anyone in similar position getting more than 4k Metis in votes.\nFor some reference, we have hosted multiple Metis AMA\u2019s, made connections with other projects and friends, joined and connected with Metis groups, run Metis campaigns, onboarded 70k New Metis wallets, we tweeted about our vote, we made discord announcement, we posted on Telegram, we asked Metis communities in group chat to vote\nAnd after all that we got 3.4k votes and barely any views on our proposal, and Futuris who was being voted for at the same time as us got 3k Metis in votes, so even less.\nNow market conditions are even worse than 3 weeks ago.\nAmount of $METIS held in wallets does not = Amount of $METIS in Active voting wallets.\nI suggest lowering the $METIS amount requirement\nLONGTERM\nLongterm I suggest changing the whole system itself, I have some ideas but for another day.\nThis system is a great idea in theory but not sustainable in the longterm in my opinion, too many external factors that could end up causing disruption and annoyances as it is right now.\nIt\u2019s also not a very friendly onboarding process for new Metis projects when scaling the amount of New projects Metis wants to onboard.\nA voting process should be according to whether a project is doing something good, product, utility, or anything Metis values.\nIt should not be based on who has better marketing and campaigning, or who is connected to more whales that hold Metis or which project is more liked by community members.\nCause currently this is whats expected of us.\nThank you look forward to be apart of change and improvement, and I love seeing the effort from Metis to find ways to do better for the chain and for the community!"

                "comment": "@Joey thanks so much for sharing this. I really appreciate your thoughts and all the effort you\u2019ve put into engaging the Metis community. These are real issues\u2014low voter turnout, whale influence, and market dependency\u2014that I\u2019ve also been looking at.\nThat said, there are risks\u2014a lower quorum makes it easier for a small group to push things through, and we still need to avoid governance capture. Build Finance, Yearn, Compound, Pocket Network, etc etc all had well-known issues.\nBest practice is to make changes incrementally, with a good rule of thumb being 30%. I think if we limit the quorum reduction to ONLY CVP votes, that would reduce the risks enough to stretch to a 50% reduction, taking into account the market conditions as you mention. With the addition of the increased outreach initiatives as per #2 in MIP-5 above, I expect reaching this new token quorum should be even easier.\nTherefore, I\u2019d like to propose a practical immediate step of lowering the quorum for CVP votes to 5k METIS. I will update the above MIP-5 proposal accordingly.\nMedium-term, we should absolutely look at studying the correlation between proposal votes and market conditions, but with the token minimum and outreach mechanisms (eg podcast) in place, which I think will change things significantly. We\u2019re also already studying reputation-based voting, incentives for consistent voters, adjustments based on actual participation trends, among others. I\u2019m planning at least 1 new temp check next week, with many more to come."

As we discussed, and you agreed, there is currently nothing approaching a fair vote for any of the CVP projects. Whales and bot farms dictate the results. Why is this not highlighted as the current problem being solved? Without fully acknowledging the current issue you hinder any meaningful discussion whilst also simply absolving Metis of its current shortcomings.\n0.1 Metis minimum will likely do nothing to dissuade the current sybil attackers or future ones. For a 100 account farm, that\u2019s like $200. You really think that will be too much of a financial stretch.\nWhy is Proof of Personage not being developed as a solution? The tech exists. It is much more robust than anything listed here. It does not require doxing.\nWhat steps will be taken to address projects that passed quorum that should not have?"

                "comment": "Thank you for the feedback! #1-3 are related to Sybils and Whales controlling the outcomes of votes. The current system attempted to fix this by splitting the number of Metis voted (10k) and the number of wallets voting (500). This proposal reduces the requirements (5k Metis from 400 unique wallets), adds a economic barrier to Sybils (0.1 Metis), and makes the process generally accessible to both the Metis community (batch voting) and Projects (fast-track option). The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the usage of CVP System. There is an intent to create additional requirements (tiered verification) for project evaluations, which will have higher requirements to pass.\nThere are ways to associate activity using on-chain data, the problem is that any restrictions based on this would make it difficult for real users to participate. I think that minimal changes to the existing system with the goal of increasing participation and extending it with additional verification methods with increased restrictions for both projects and reviewers would work best.\nFor #4, because the projects passed under specific requirements, all projects that met those requirements should keep their status. As mentioned, tiered verification is planned and projects that passed CVP are not guaranteed to pass other verification tiers."

        "content": "[Temp Check] CVP Upgrade Proposal\nIntro\nThis post is a \u201ctemperature check\u201d to gather feedback and community sentiment about the below draft ideas. In order to make progress quickly and keep things as simple as possible, I have separated ideas into \u201cnow\u201d and \u201clater\u201d sections, including only a few simple updates in the \u201cnow\u201d section. This way hopefully we can move forward quickly with a few changes, measure their effectiveness, and then repeat the cycle with continuous improvements and measurements.\nDraft Proposal for Phased Upgrade to the CVP System\nObjective: Community Verified Projects Program and Badge\nTo maximize the success of the maximum number of high-quality dApps launching on Metis by:\nIncreasing participation in eligibility votes to boost community engagement and project awareness.\nReducing Sybil votes to ensure accurate measurement of community sentiment.\nEnhancing safety and transparency for users researching new projects.\nAllocating marketing resources effectively to balance project reach and quality.\nMotivation\nCommunity Engagement and Awareness:\nProjects new to Metis often struggle to connect with tokenholders, and the number of projects makes it difficult for tokenholders to efficiently DYOR. Metis Foundation\u2019s role is to create a resource-efficient system that supports projects in engaging with the community while making it easy for the community to DYOR.\n\u201cGovernance fatigue\u201d is a common issue in web3. To combat this, participation in governance should be made as easy and meaningful as possible.\nCurrently, raising awareness for CVP votes often requires manual interventions such as DMs to tokenholders. This is inefficient and unsustainable.\nSybil Attack Mitigation:\nFake wallets are more prevalent than desired and, in some cases, have helped projects meet quorum. While the impact is minimized because marketing resources remain at the discretion of Metis Foundation, improving \u201cSybil defenses\u201d is critical for decentralizing decision-making.\nReducing Sybil votes will also make marketing metrics more accurate, thereby increasing marketing effectiveness as participation rates rise.\nSafety and Transparency:\nUsers need more tools to conduct meaningful research on projects. The system should incentivize projects to increase transparency and make it easier for tokenholders to evaluate them.\nEffective Resource Allocation:\nSome projects mistakenly believe passing CVP guarantees unlimited Metis Foundation marketing support. This is not feasible for all projects and does not align with strategic resource allocation.\nCVP is already defined as granting eligibility for support rather than guaranteeing it. As the system evolves, future enhancements can further clarify eligibility criteria.\nPhased Upgrade Proposal\nPhase 1: Now (Immediate Actions)\n1. Structural Changes\nVoting Minimums:\nSet a minimum of 0.1 METIS to participate in governance votes.\nReduce quorum to 400 unique wallets (from 500) to balance reduced Sybil votes and sustained participation.\nJustification: Lowers the impact of Sybil attacks, while maintaining an accessible entry barrier. Encourages participation by those aligned with the Metis ecosystem.\nBatch Voting:\nGroup votes into batches of 3\u20135 projects, held monthly or bi-monthly. Use Snapshot\u2019s existing Approval Voting Mechanism to group the votes into one, without changing anything else.\nJustification: Reduces governance fatigue and streamlines community participation.\nFast-Track Option:\nAllow projects to opt out of batching and AI podcasts if they prefer an immediate vote and believe they can reach quorum independently.\nJustification: Provides flexibility for high-priority or well-established projects.\n2. Outreach Initiatives\nAI-Generated Podcast:\nUse tools like NotebookLM to create engaging 5\u201310 minute podcasts summarizing project details.\nIntegration Example:\nProjects provide key information (e.g., pitch decks) via a submission form.\nPodcasts are shared on the Metis ecosystem portal and governance Twitter.\nProject Showcases (AMAs/Shill Sessions):\nSchedule live sessions for project teams to pitch directly to the community during the eligibility voting period.\nJustification: Increases community trust and engagement with projects.\n3. Marketing Resource Clarification\nClearly communicate that passing CVP votes makes projects eligible for marketing support but does not guarantee it. This is already noted in the documentation here.\nEnsure all communications emphasize this distinction to avoid misunderstandings.\nConditions for Advancing to Future Phases\nVoting Participation:\nCVP votes consistently meet quorum (400 wallets, 10k METIS) without manual intervention beyond outreach initiatives.\nSybil Votes:\nObvious Sybil vote percentage is consistently below 10%.\nCommunity Engagement:\nMetrics (e.g., AMA attendance, podcast listening rates) indicate meaningful use of outreach initiatives.\nReassessing Phase 1:\nIf data suggests Phase 1 changes are ineffective, the strategy will be revisited before advancing to future phases.\nPhase 2: Later (Future Enhancements)\nThis section is intended to show the direction of the CVP program\u2019s evolution. It is illustrative and not part of the current temperature check or proposed governance vote.\nTiered Verification System:\nIntroduce multi-level project verification, with illustrative examples:\nLevel 1: Basic eligibility (current CVP vote structure).\nLevel 2: Additional requirements (e.g., audits, partial/ZK KYC).\nLevel 3: High-trust status (e.g., community-led audits, open-source verification).\nDisplay badges for each level on https://projects.ceg.vote.\nJustification: Gradual scaling incentivizes transparency and safety without overwhelming early-stage projects.\nEnhanced Safety Features:\nImplement annual (or more frequent) batch renewals requiring community-led safety audits.\nJustification: Encourages projects to maintain progress and ensures ongoing safety.\nCommunity Investigations and Rewards:\nIntroduce incentives for community members to conduct thorough evaluations (e.g., bug bounties, investigative reports).\nJustification: Strengthens project accountability and fosters active community engagement.\nConclusion\nThis phased plan improves CVP alignment with Metis\u2019 strategic goals, addressing immediate challenges while setting a foundation for future growth. By balancing community engagement, Sybil mitigation, transparency, and resource allocation, this proposal ensures the CVP system evolves sustainably to meet the needs of the Metis ecosystem.\nQuestions\nWhat do you like about this?\nWhat would you adjust to make it even better?\nWhat do you think is the most important item to include in the \u201cnow\u201d section?",

I host an open Twitter space every week to invite the projects that are up to vote as one way to introduce them to the community. However, most aren\u2019t even aware that these exist and I get little to no support from the rest of the Metis/Metis Governance team. But what really perked my ears up was the AI generated pods to increase accessibility to the project info, USPs, use cases, etc\u2026\nI\u2019m also excited about the immediate upgrades such as reducing the quorum to 400 and raising the requirement to .1 per wallet. This aligns with your overall goals of increasing accessibility while still maintaining solid sybil protection.\nLooking forward to these upgrades and am excited to help implement them."

                "comment": "Great questions @crypto4ell !\nStepping through your comments:\nRe: 0.1 token threshold:\nI agree, you\u2019re probably right that 0.1 is too low. That said, we have to balance this with the resulting reduced numbers of voters (for now). According to my back tests, adjusting quorum from 500 to 400 wallets, while at the same time establishing the 0.1 METIS minimum should have a net zero effect on our ability to reach quorum. It is a MAJOR challenge for great new projects if they are unable to reach quorum to earn their CVP status.\nI would propose that we \u201cstart small\u201d with this change, make sure we can continue to reach quorum (especially with the new proposed outreach initiatives) and then further increase the minimum from there.\nChecking Sybils\nNeither this change, nor this proposal, is meant to be \u201cperfect\u201d. It\u2019s logical that establishing a minimum won\u2019t increase Sybil activity, and that\u2019s as far as we get with this proposal.\nThat said, there are several METIS community members (who wish to remain anonymous) who have done pretty extensive reviews and back tests, and there are several tools such as BubbleMaps that I think could help. If you have suggestions, or would like to help, please share!\nNotebookLM\nI agree that this tool definitely isn\u2019t perfect. I think this is a great reason to start small (eg on the @MetisGovernance X account with ~7k followers) and iterate fast. That said, I highly recommend that you listen to the sample podcast it generated (via the notion link in my reply above). It pronounces \u201cMetis\u201d wrong - which I have a fix for - but otherwise I think it does a pretty great job.\nThis is meant as an experiment, with low risk, and based on the results we can come back with adjustments and a new proposal. This is why I used the \u201cnow\u201d and \u201clater\u201d framing of the proposal: small changes, see what happens, iterate.\nCommunity Engagement Metrics\nI absolutely intend to share metrics, AND, they aren\u2019t finalized yet. This is one of those cases where we\u2019d actually have to do the project to see which combination of metrics is easily available.\nAre there specific metrics you think would be particularly important?"

                "comment": "Appreciate the thread, Daryl. Love to see these CEG forums becoming more active, Shoutout to Ace for kickstarting this activity and to all the Metisians who have shared their thoughts. This is how we build a strong, genuine, authentic community that can take our ecosystem to great heights if we truly absorb the creativity being shared here.\nI think now is a critical time in Metis\u2019 trajectory - we are at a crossroads. Will we utilize community input in our path forward or remain perceivably aloof and disconnected? I think our stregnth lies in our diehard, committed Metis heads who are our users, builders, and contributors to the Metis eco. Having a smaller, more intimate community gives us the chance to do things differently and truly build an ecosystem from the ground up. This is our chance to set ourselves apart from every other network - in terms of both technology and approach.\nI think the AI and tech roadmap are great and will finally have us back competing with the top L2s again. I think the AI infra can put us in a position that enhances and positively transforms how we approach decentralization. AI can serve as the bridge between our technical capabilities and our community-driven aspirations in several ways:\nFirst, AI can help democratize complex decision-making processes by providing data-driven insights that all community members can understand and act upon, not just technical experts. This levels the playing field and enables true community governance. Imagine AI systems that can analyze proposed protocol changes and present their implications in clear, accessible terms to all stakeholders.\nSecond, AI can automate and optimize network operations while maintaining decentralization. Rather than relying on centralized management, AI can help distribute resources, manage network load, and adjust parameters based on real-time usage patterns - all while adhering to community-set guidelines. (Putting the A in DAO)\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, AI can help scale our community engagement without losing the intimate, personal touch that makes Metis special. AI tools can help moderate discussions, surface important community proposals, and even help translate technical concepts into terms that newer members can grasp easily.\nBy integrating AI thoughtfully into both our technical infrastructure and community management, we can create a truly decentralized network that remains efficient and user-friendly. This is how Metis can lead the way in showing how blockchain networks can be both technically sophisticated and genuinely community-driven.\nCan\u2019t wait to see the responses to Daryl\u2019s post! We\u2019re all here because we all want to see Metis thrive, so let\u2019s keep these convos going and work together to make it happen!"

                "comment": "Metis SDK: A Gateway for More Builders\nAs a newer developer, one thing I believe could be impactful is a Metis SDK. With proper marketing and partnerships (e.g., Thirdweb, Alchemy, etc\u2026), this could make developing on Metis 10x easier and attract more builders to the ecosystem.\nSome ideas for the SDK include:\nPlug-and-play modules: Tools for gasless transactions, AI integration, voting, token gating, and DeFi primitives like lending/borrowing.\nCross-chain bridge plugins: Seamless interoperability with chains like Solana, Base, and Ethereum to encourage greater activity.\nIndexing tools: Native solutions or integration with alternatives to The Graph for efficient data querying.\nThis SDK would lower barriers for developers and position Metis as a chain optimized for innovation and ease of use. The sooner it\u2019s available, the faster we can empower builders to create impactful projects.\nFiat Onboarding: Reducing Friction for Users\nAnother area that could greatly boost adoption is seamless fiat onboarding. Moonshot, while focused on memecoins, sets a great example of how intuitive onboarding can be. Features like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and credit/debit card integration could significantly lower friction for users entering the Metis ecosystem.\nEven if Metis doesn\u2019t build this directly, incubating or partnering with a company to create these fiat on-ramps could make it much easier for users to fund wallets and interact with Metis-based dApps.\nEnsuring Grants Go to Sustainable Projects\nIt\u2019s also essential to ensure grants are allocated responsibly, particularly for larger amounts. Leveraging decentralized identity (DID) and proof of personhood could help:\nFor Grants:\nVerify recipients\u2019 authenticity to prevent duplicate entities or bad actors from farming the Metis Foundation.\nTrack accountability with transparent, tamper-proof records of grant allocation and usage.\nFor Governance:\nEnsure the authenticity of governance participants with proof of personhood to avoid sybil attacks or manipulation by bots.\nBuild trust by guaranteeing that decision-making is fair and representative.\nBy integrating these tools, Metis could create a more secure, trustworthy approach to funding and governance, safeguarding its resources while fostering sustainable growth.\nFinal Thoughts\nTo me, the SDK feels like the main priority because it directly empowers developers like me to build faster and with fewer barriers. Paired with seamless fiat onboarding and tools for sustainable grants and governance, Metis could establish itself as a leader in developer-friendly innovation and ecosystem integrity.\nI\u2019m excited to see how we can smash 2025 together.\n-cobi"

                "comment": "Hi Daryl, nice to connect with you, and good community-focused post\nI see thoughts from Anthony and Cobi and I agree with the areas they touched and the pov, so no need for repetition.\nFor the new network direction, sadly however, I still feel this is Metis chasing another trend. Important questions need to be asked and answered convincingly internally.\nIs AI really what Metis wants to focus on now and not just chasing a trend?\nWould the team still be vested towards AI should the whole AI hype rn goes low?\nBeen in Metis for a while now and have seen Metis change different directions, and even sadly, has always come out late to the trend party or get stuck on the narrative.\nI\u2019m not a tech guy or builder - I\u2019m a social contributor, and as such can speak better on the social side of things.\nLove the idea of a structured identity. Metis needs it, needs to stick to it while also competing in terms of tech and ease of building - having that robust economy and an identity. Arbitrum is known for DeFi and gaming, don\u2019t mean other areas don\u2019t flourish. Base is known for onboarding both trad and on-chain builders, artists etc, don\u2019t mean other sectors don\u2019t flourish. Metis needs that robustness.\nMetis needs that tech upgrade more badly than it knows. Being unique and different is good, but it\u2019s no point if it\u2019s not easy to onboard. Blockchain has become way easy for people to deploy, get access to materials, and build cool sh*t without hassle, and this hasn\u2019t been the case for most builders on Metis. Happen to have overheard in a few Dev discussions and support groups and the experience isn\u2019t pleasing.\nLastly, at least if Metis is going to chase a trend, which I understand (reason it needs to have the robust infra), at least make haste to catch up on time. Metis was late to DeFi szn, late to meme szn, late to AI szn, and even now with AI agents.\nHere\u2019s the attached response I gave on a recent post from Quantic - perhaps it contains more aspects I didn\u2019t touch here:\n\"It\u2019s scarce these days seeing a good honest post on CEG about the network and I love that there\u2019s been genuine \u2018uproars\u2019 from the community - shows dissatisfaction, but still wanting to build and see the network work.\nI agree with you especially in the area of identity, which I believe is what affects the marketing alignment. You can sell yourself when you don\u2019t know what you are.\nBeen in core social contributor in the ecosystem since 2021, and have seen Metis transition into different narratives/take up diff identities - onboarding web2 businesses (DACs), DeFi chain, \u2018best tech\u2019 (hybrid rollup) etc and now is even hard to talk socially about without looking aimless. Then the trial and errors of chasing trends, only to still be late to them, and also the stress of building on the network as I\u2019ve always heard Devs complain on how \u2018complicated/incomplete\u2019 the tech infra is to deploy and launch even basic tokens (this particular reason is why I love the new roadmap to upgrade the network and become full EVM compatible, only that then we\u2019d have better edge than other L2s with the deSeq and other specs)\nI really do hope things turn around for the better and we head back to the top .\nSigned. Prince Omobee\""

                "comment": "Hey Daryl!\nI do appreciate the community engagement post. I\u2019ve been holding METIS since summer 2022 and in the depths of the Bear Market I was looking for the right project to attach myself too.\nI\u2019m a METIS maxi because truly I don\u2019t see any other L2 with a great combination of fundamentals and ROI in the L2 space. Truly a gem.\nMy perspective plainly comes from a user and someone who engages in social media with crypto in general. I\u2019ve seen my fair share of projects that show red flags when communication is lacking and when updates are delayed or non existent. Getting even a whiff of that from METIS was disappointing to me.\nIt\u2019s very fixable though. So I will answer the questions that I feel that I can provide some insight to from the perspective of a METIS user and social media user.\nWhat specific areas of the strategy would benefit from more detailed explanation? What channels of communication would be most accessible for you?\nPart 1: I think educating your community on what Data Availability and Fraud Proofs are would be an excellent start. Technical jargon can get us lost. Literally dumbing it down in language for the user so it\u2019s understandable can go a long way.\nPart 2: X and Telegram are musts, but Ripple made deep headway into Instagram Reels and Tik tok. Short succinct videos or reels with price predictions really helped people be exposed to XRP. Some will just obviously put money in, but others may be intrigued enough to use the network.\nWith the planned regular updates for Q1, how could we make it as engaging and interesting as possible?\nIdk if you have seen the X account\nhttps://x.com/year_progress?s=21\nBut a progress bar that can show progress towards DA, Fraud Proofs, or even Stage 1 L2 Status would be a fun visual and daily reminder that not only are you working on the stated roadmap but it shows the community that you are executing.\nSomething like this:\nWhat engagement format resonates with you the most?\nI love hearing updates in X spaces. But, if you can get specifically the head of marketing to engage with the community\u2026 it would go a long way in bringing morale up for the believers.\nFor example, They can buy a monkex or lofi llama nft (both native to METIS) and have a post on X proving their engagement, it would show that leadership themselves are interested in their own ecosystem. Showing excitement for both, bigger well known projects and smaller native projects on METIS would create a sense of ownership. Treating both with care and respect would show the community that METIS is for everyone.\nNo better example of this being Vitalik, embracing the Milady community is an excellent way of promoting Ethereum Culture.\nShout out to Elena, Quantic, and Anthony. They are there in the METIS trenches with us, with the community. They have the pulse of what the community wants and leadership listening to them and their experiences with the community would do METIS justice.\nWhat unique advantages should we develop in the AI vertical? How can we better differentiate Metis?\nPart 1: I don\u2019t have a fully developed opinion on this but I\u2019m glad METIS is deciding to go all in on AI. It\u2019s the future. The MAC initiative is very promising. Gathering native projects and having them collaborate is such a great idea. LazAI providing infrastructure would make them our very own Virtuals from Base on METIS. I\u2019m bullish.\nPart 2: I believe if we can get Stage 1 L2 classification, it would be a giant green flag waved towards investors and builders to come and use the tech. An emphatic push by METIS to say yes we are the first Stage 1 L2 with a Decentralized Sequencer would grab the attention of many, including Vitalik. It would legitimize us a strong player. A rightful top 5 L2. It\u2019s what METIS deserves.\nSeeing this on L2 Beat:\nIt\u2019s a stain on what METIS truly is. That graphic doesn\u2019t represent my view of METIS as a user of the tech. Trust me, I am not a fan of L2 Beat\u2026 No mentions from them ever. But Having them as \u201cGatekeepers\u201d to evaluating the L2 space can be a hindrance in attracting users, investors, and Builders. Let\u2019s get that graphic green and find our rightful place in the L2 space.\nhttps://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/metis\nThank you for listening to me. I\u2019ll see you all in the METIS trenches."

The topic at hand is one we can no longer ignore: the long-standing neglect of the Metis African Community.\nLet me be clear: the African community under Metis is dead. It has been for a very long time, and the silence around this issue is deafening. This isn\u2019t just my opinion; it\u2019s the undeniable truth. For a community that represents a continent teeming with untapped potential, vibrant culture, and some of the most resilient, innovative people on the planet, the lack of effort and attention is both disappointing and infuriating.\nI\u2019ve raised this issue before, even mentioning it recently on Metis CEG, and I\u2019ll say it again: we need change. We\u2019re not asking for miracles, just the bare minimum effort to ensure that the African community under Metis is alive, thriving, and contributing to the ecosystem.\nLet\u2019s get specific. I spoke with Nano, and we\u2019ve shared our frustrations. He has reached out to the people supposedly in charge of the African community, and guess what? He got the same cold shoulders I did. No real engagement. No events. No outreach. No X Spaces. Nothing. Just a ghost town with the occasional link dropped into a dead Telegram group. How is this acceptable?\nDo you know what\u2019s worse? We don\u2019t even know who the current \u201cAfrican community members\u201d are. If there are still any active members, they must be hiding because there has been no activity, no connection, no movement\u2014just radio silence. It\u2019s likely most of them have already left Metis because, frankly, why would anyone stick around when nothing is happening?\nNano and I Are Ready to Take the Mantle\nEnough is enough. If the current team in charge isn\u2019t going to do anything, then Nano and I are stepping up. We\u2019re not just talking about this for the sake of talking; we\u2019re ready to revive the Metis African Community and transform it into something that the entire Metis ecosystem can be proud of.\nAnd let\u2019s be real: this isn\u2019t about money. We\u2019re not asking for financial handouts or compensation. This is about doing what\u2019s necessary to unlock the potential of a community that has been criminally overlooked. We\u2019re willing to put in the work, but we need Metis\u2019 support and approval to move forward.\nIf we\u2019re being honest, the lack of response from the team managing the African community suggests something fishy might be going on. How do you justify doing almost nothing except dropping occasional links to Metis Spaces in the group? There are no events, no consistent engagement, no opportunities for African members to connect or grow. It\u2019s a disgrace, and it can\u2019t continue.\nWhat We Would Do If Given the Opportunity\nIf Metis supports us, here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do to revive and elevate the African community:\nHost Weekly X Spaces: Create a platform for African voices within Metis. Weekly discussions on relevant topics, ranging from Web3 education to opportunities within the Metis ecosystem.\nReal-Life Events: Organize meetups, workshops, and hackathons across major African cities to connect members and onboard new users to Metis.\nEducational Campaigns: Launch initiatives to teach people in Africa about Metis, blockchain technology, and the possibilities of Web3.\nCommunity Challenges and Contests: Boost engagement through creative competitions that encourage members to contribute actively while showcasing the talent within the African community.\nAmplify Visibility: Build stronger visibility for Metis in Africa through collaborations, partnerships, and strategic marketing efforts tailored to the region.\nRebuild the Telegram Group: Identify active members, onboard Africans and grow it into a lively, interactive space that fosters genuine connections and ideas.\nFuturis is Proof That We Can Build\nIf you need evidence of what we\u2019re capable of, just look at Futuris. This project has proven that with the right vision, leadership, and dedication, it\u2019s possible to build a vibrant, active community that\u2019s both engaged and productive.

All we need is your trust and approval to make it happen on a larger scale.\nThe Clock Is Ticking\nIf nothing is done within a few days of this message, we\u2019ll have no choice but to conclude that Metis has completely neglected the African community and has no interest in changing that. It would be devastating to realize that a project with so much potential and ambition could turn its back on such a vital part of its global community.\nMetis claims to be about decentralization, empowerment, and community. Prove it. Show us that those words mean something. Give us the green light to take action, and we\u2019ll show you what\u2019s possible when the African community is given the attention and respect it deserves.\nThis isn\u2019t just a plea; it\u2019s a call to action.

                "comment": "Hi Savagee,\nThank you for your thoughtful post and for taking the time to share your concerns and suggestions. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re deeply passionate about the African community within Metis, and I appreciate the effort you\u2019ve put into bringing this back into focus.\nA lot of what you\u2019ve said resonates with our broader goals as a global community. It is evident that, regions like LATAM, Vietnam, Africa, APAC, and India are embracing crypto at incredible rates, and we see the potential for Metis to grow in all these regions. The foundation\u2019s goal has always been to support the ecosystem as a whole, with resources distributed globally where they\u2019re needed most and we strive to always achieve them as evident in our on-chain metrics and Messari report.\nmessari.io \u2013 15 Jan 25\nMetis Q4 2024 Brief\nWhile the overall market environment fluctuated, Metis demonstrated steady progress through increased activity, notable partnerships, and strategic expansions.\nWhen it comes to hosting X Spaces, you don\u2019t need approval from the team to get started. Groups like VestaDAO have shown how effective community-led spaces can be, and these are great examples of what\u2019s possible when members take initiative. Spaces like theirs help drive discussions and build visibility, and we\u2019d love to see the same from the African community.\nFor in-person events like hackathons or workshops, our events team focuses on global initiatives to make sure anyone can participate, regardless of where they are. These events are designed to be inclusive and open to all, rather than region-specific.\nFor the big recognized industry events, Metis is almost always present, like the recent DevCon in Bangkok and upcoming EthDenver. Including Metis making a presence in EthSafari in Kenya, EthAccra in Ghana, and Africa Tech week in Cape Town South Africa.\nOnce again, thank you for raising these points and for continuing the conversation, even after reaching out via email. Your energy and commitment are exactly what we need in this ecosystem.\nThank you.\nElena."

                "comment": "I must address some key points that remain unspoken. More than 80% of Futurians and the individuals I\u2019ve successfully onboarded into Metis are Nigerians. Nigeria is one of the fastest-growing crypto hubs globally, yet it wasn\u2019t even mentioned in your response alongside regions like LATAM, Vietnam, and APAC. This omission speaks volumes and feels like a missed opportunity to recognize the potential and dedication that exists here. You people should really not be sleeping on NIGERIA!\nYou mentioned hosting X Spaces as a way to engage the community. While that\u2019s a great initiative, I can confidently say we\u2019ve hosted countless spaces dedicated to onboarding people into Metis. I\u2019ve personally gone above and beyond, pushing Metis relentlessly in these spaces. There\u2019s even evidence to back this up. Yet, almost every time someone new joins, their first question is, \u201cWhat is Metis?\u201d This highlights not just a lack of awareness but a lack of structural support to amplify these efforts. Asking us to do more without recognizing or directly supporting what has already been done feels disheartening.\nWhen it comes to events, the potential here is massive. If we hosted an event in Nigeria, with the community we\u2019ve already built, the turnout would be incredible. Nigeria is a crypto powerhouse, and the numbers speak for themselves. It\u2019s surprising that Metis hasn\u2019t leveraged this region more strategically, despite its potential to significantly boost the ecosystem.\nNow, on to Metis Africa itself: how exactly is \u201cMetis Africa\u201d supporting builders from this region? How is it encouraging Metisians? How many African projects has it supported or even highlighted? What is its purpose, if I may ask? Because from the outside, it\u2019s unclear what tangible impact Metis Africa has had. To make matters worse, the official Metis Africa account hasn\u2019t made an official tweet in almost a year! This gives the impression that the initiative is dead or dormant, which doesn\u2019t inspire confidence or engagement from the community here.\nA member of the Metis team once told me, \u201cwe have a very active Nigerian community.\u201d With all due respect, that statement feels completely disconnected from the reality on ground. The Nigerian Metis community barely exists in any structured or visible way. If not for the efforts of a few individuals like myself, there wouldn\u2019t be any presence at all.\nMetis has an incredible opportunity here, but for this potential to be unlocked, there needs to be direct recognition, support, and visible action. Builders and advocates like Nano and myself are willing to put in the work, but the foundation must meet us halfway by creating systems that genuinely support African builders and amplify our voices.\nThank you once again for taking the time to engage with this conversation. I remain committed to advocating for Metis and seeing it thrive in Africa - Nigeria to be precise, but I hope these concerns are addressed meaningfully so we can move forward together."

While we don\u2019t focus on one specific country, we truly appreciate you highlighting Nigeria\u2019s massive potential as a crypto hub, that is very true. This will definitely be considered in future discussions around regional and community strategies.\nIt\u2019s clear that you\u2019re passionate about advocating for Metis, and I encourage you to apply to the Metis Advocates Program. Many of our advocates are already from Nigeria and Africa, and your ideas would be a valuable addition. You can apply here: Metis Advocates Program\nFor builders and projects in Nigeria, foundational support is open to everyone globally through platforms like Gitcoin and Thrive. These initiatives accelerate growth for Metis-based projects, and we encourage all builders to explore these opportunities.\nThanks again for your suggestions, we truly value your dedication to the ecosystem!\nElena."

I kept holding on, hoping for some acknowledgment or response, but at this point, I\u2019ve run out of hope!\nI\u2019ve given my energy, my passion, and my dedication to advocating for Metis because I believe so strongly in its vision and potential. But this silence, this lack of communication is part of what completely broke me to speak out on the \u201cMetis Africa\u201d saga.\nIt is well.\nThank you again for your response, and for the wonderful work you and your team continue to do."

Over the past 3 months, I have personally onboarded more than 120 Africans into the Metis ecosystem\u2014not as an influencer or KOL but simply as someone who deeply believes in the transformative potential of this technology. Even before building Futuris, my focus has always been on educating and welcoming people into Web3, making the transition as seamless as possible for newcomers. This journey has taught me a lot about the hurdles new users face, particularly when it comes to navigating complex tools and interfaces.\nToday, I want to share a vision for an essential piece of infrastructure we desperately need: a simple, native wallet for Metis\u2014something akin to Phantom Wallet, but designed specifically for our ecosystem.\nThe Problem: Complexity and Accessibility\nCurrently, Metis does not have a truly simple and intuitive wallet that is tailored for onboarding newcomers. While GM\u00b2 exists and provides a range of functionalities, it is far more than just a wallet\u2014it is a social platform where users can post, interact, and do much more. While this is innovative and valuable, its complexity can overwhelm users who are new to Web3 and simply need a straightforward way to manage their assets and interact with the blockchain.\nAs someone who has worked directly with beginners and people who had no idea about Metis, I\u2019ve often struggled to confidently recommend a wallet where users can easily:\nStore and manage their Metis tokens and other assets.\nSwap Metis and other tokens within the ecosystem.\nPay transaction fees exclusively in Metis without confusion.\nNavigate the interface without feeling intimidated.\nThese barriers are not just technical but emotional. The complexity discourages adoption, especially in regions like Africa, where Web3 adoption is growing rapidly but requires user-friendly tools to gain widespread traction.\nWhy Simplicity Matters\nPhantom Wallet is a shining example of what we need. It\u2019s simple, elegant, and easy to use. It focuses solely on being a wallet and does that job exceptionally well. Imagine having a similar app for Metis\u2014an app where users can:\nEasily set up and manage wallets without technical know-how.\nSwap Metis tokens and other assets seamlessly.\nUse Metis as the native token for all transactions.\nAccess the app on iOS and Android with a polished and intuitive design.\nBuy Metis directly using Apple Pay or Google Pay (maybe, maybe not)\nSuch simplicity would lower the entry barrier for new users and empower the Metis ecosystem to scale faster. It\u2019s not just a convenience; it\u2019s a necessity.\nThe Opportunity: ByBit Integration and African Adoption\nBeyond the wallet, there is another key opportunity to increase Metis adoption: making it easily exchangeable on ByBit, one of the most widely used exchanges in Africa. ByBit\u2019s presence and popularity in the region make it an ideal platform for onboarding Africans into Metis. If Metis were listed on ByBit to be able to be swapped to, it would simplify the process of acquiring the token, making it more accessible to a broader audience. However, this may require a separate initiative, so for now, the focus remains on the wallet.\nThe Proposal: A Native Wallet for Metis\nI propose that the Metis community prioritize the development of a simple, native wallet designed specifically for the Metis ecosystem. Here are the key features such a wallet should include:\nSimplicity First: A clean and intuitive interface, with minimal steps required to create and use a wallet.\nToken Management: Seamless storage and management of Metis and other tokens under the Metis ecosystem.\nIn-App Swapping: The ability to swap Metis and other tokens directly within the app.\nExclusive Metis Fees: All transaction fees paid exclusively in Metis, reinforcing the utility of the token.\nMobile Accessibility: Availability on both iOS and Android platforms.\nOn-Ramp Solutions: The ability to buy Metis using Apple Pay, Google Pay, or other payment methods, making it easy for newcomers to acquire Metis.\nSecurity: Top-notch security measures, ensuring user assets are safe.\nCall to Action\nThis is not just a wish\u2014it\u2019s something we need yesterday. A native wallet would transform the Metis experience for both new and existing users, making the blockchain more accessible and fostering greater adoption. It\u2019s time for us, as a community, to rally around this idea and push for its realization.\nI am ready to bring this idea to life with my team and collaborate with anyone who shares the same vision. This is not a solo mission; it is a collective effort, and I welcome contributors who are passionate about creating an accessible and user-friendly future for Metis. However, I also want to emphasize that this idea should not be ignored or, worse, stolen. It\u2019s something that requires immediate attention and action to ensure it benefits the Metis ecosystem as a whole.\nThank you for taking the time to read this proposal. I\u2019m excited to hear your thoughts and collaborate with all of you to bring this idea to life.\nWarm regards,\nSavagee\nAdvocate for Metis & Founder of Futuris",

        "content": "Metis L2 is going through a period of change, and since this is a good opportunity for the whole community to realign and grow together, I want to share some thoughts on things that have been happening and also what the future might look like for us to be successful as an ecosystem.\nContext and Expectations:\nBefore we continue, I want to acknowledge that things haven\u2019t been going so well for Metis L2 over the past few weeks and the team has been working hard behind the scenes to make sure we find our North Star. Also, I want to make it clear that I can\u2019t share too many details about future plans as this must be done through official communication channels. The thoughts I will share below are personal and come from someone who is heavily invested in Metis and its ecosystem, and someone who aims to provide as much support as humanly possible to make us succeed.\nWhat is at stake with ReGenesis?\nThere is absolutely no reason why Metis L2 cannot be among the top 3\u20135 Layer 2 solutions. With its strong history of innovation, the potential of Metis is significant\u2014and that\u2019s one of the main reasons so many people keep supporting this project. There is little recognition of this from certain communities in crypto, but Metis has been thinking of new ideas and executing them for quite some time, with alternative DAs and decentralized sequencers being prime examples of this. Now that ReGenesis is starting to be shared, I can assure you that the plan is ambitious and can certainly make Metis stand out once again. The plan targets innovative technological solutions in key growth areas that, if executed correctly, can become clear differentiators in the L2 landscape and a very attractive positioning for anyone in this industry. Considering Metis\u2019 performance so far and the fact that we are in a bull market, ReGenesis introduces an opportunity for a great comeback for our ecosystem and we must work together to ensure it is a success. In this sense, what I want to encourage here is simple: if you are a member of the community, stay connected and help builders make the most out of their products; if you are a builder, now is the time to ship. For the Metis team this works the same way, it\u2019s time to push further with more commitment and hard work. Personally, I will do my best as always and I have no doubt that we have everything it takes to succeed. ReGenesis is a unique opportunity to reset the room, act with awareness and demonstrate the great potential of Metis and its partners.\nIdentity, Storytelling and Communications:\nMetis was created to facilitate the web3 economy, and while this mission is laudable, the concrete paths are uncertain as it is a very broad vision. I\u2019m pretty sure if you ask people what Metis is about and what their core narrative is, you\u2019ll struggle to find strong coherence because a clear identity and narrative hasn\u2019t been forged yet. Note that this is not an easy task, and that ReGenesis also provides an opportunity to help craft this. I think what Elena shared earlier about important questions that can help define Metis should be taken with deep consideration (link). I\u2019ll provide my personal view on this at the end of this post. I encourage everyone who truly cares about Metis to take the time and share about this.\nNow let\u2019s talk about communications, which is the most important thing that needs to be fixed as soon as possible. It doesn\u2019t matter if Metis has great technology if it doesn\u2019t communicate effectively and get enough support and engagement from the community. The situation with the announcement of an announcement and \u201cnext week\u201d are at this point painful memes. Solving these problems requires active listening and direct execution. The former allows you to truly understand the sentiment behind what is being shared, while the latter involves avoiding generating too many expectations and demonstrating effectiveness with results. If I were to approach this from the perspective of community members alone, I can say that there is still no clear communication and there is too much information shared that doesn\u2019t really say anything. Based on this, I have personally shifted my focus to increasingly focus on the builders and the support I can provide them. This is the only thing I can do to generate results within the limited position I am currently in, and I\u2019d also like to reiterate my willingness to help solve these problems as someone who has already been able to demonstrate results in these areas.\nSince all of this involves marketing one way or another, I\u2019ll finalize this part with three suggested action points:\nNo more endless farming campaigns that are not relevant, but fewer high-impact, well-planned and communicated campaigns that really generate excitement in the community because they can see and feel how they can win.\nShifting the focus of the Metis L2 account from constantly promoting projects to sharing the story of how we are going to thrive in the web3 economy together with ReGenesis, there may be an ecosystem section or account focused on highlighting our builders and their projects. Highlight the people building Metis.\nStop focusing only on sharing content for exactly the same crowd in X, amplify the message beyond that and consider efforts in other relevant platforms such as YouTube. It\u2019s not a secret that this can yield good results during a bull market. Metis should be seen as part of the L2 mainstream and Ethereum ecosystem.\nBuilders and ReGenesis:\nSomeone shared with me a comment that I found hard to digest: there are two Metis, one for insiders and one for builders. Insiders were meant to be the group of projects and builders that have preference and \u201cextra\u201d support from Metis, and builders are the rest. I must say that I was not happy to hear that since from my perspective I do my best to help all projects no matter what. That being said, there will always be people who think differently, and if you reflect and zoom out, Metis L2 is part of a larger group of companies that are part of the Metis Foundation, who are the final decision-makers and have their own vision on everything that is going on and where we should go next. ReGenesis should not be about promoting this division, but rather an opportunity to unify our efforts to achieve great results together. Needless to say, there are builders at different stages who need different types of support, but we must remain aligned on the main mission of onboarding new users and community members to our ecosystem. Nothing else matters, and I doubt that the founders have a different stance on this. For this reason, going forward I will make sure to continue to provide as much support and visibility as possible to each of the developers and entrepreneurs in our ecosystem, no matter what stage they are at. As long as they bring value to Metis and are ethical people, I will put everything I have into helping them succeed. We can always support our native builders while also bringing some of the more established ones into our ecosystem. ReGenesis is an opportunity to harmonize and find this balance.\nI know this is a long post, but I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how to improve Metis from my current position and how to raise some valid points while also acknowledging the good work that\u2019s been done so far and some of the real support that\u2019s been provided by the community. Once again, I\u2019m confident that we can leverage ReGenesis to take Metis to new heights - this is something our community deserves.\nQuestions from Elena and my answers:\nWhat are you looking for from the Metis Network?\nI\u2019m looking for something unique that sets it apart from all the other L2s. The unique people who are already contributing and the overall vision we have are good for me, but more coherence and alignment is needed with all the relevant stakeholders: the community, the team, and leadership.\nWhere do you see yourself in this Metis Web3 Economy?\nI see myself as a facilitator, which means I will do whatever I can to encourage progress in this area and onboard more people in this world. Content, mentoring, education, and community are some of my main areas of support.\nWhat do you like about Metis?\nI like that we have some passionate builders who support each other and other committed people who actually believe in something and want to improve and make something different with Metis. Like Kevin once said, Metis is an innovator, not a follower.\nWhat you don\u2019t like about Metis?\nCommunication and marketing in general are far from ideal and this needs to change. We need more clarity both with the community and internally, from the top down and vice versa. At the same time, I strongly believe that we all need to practice active listening and try to improve from there. I would say that most of the problems are already known, but the execution is unclear. Simply put, we must stop being our own worst enemy because we have everything we need to thrive.\nAnd I add more, do you hold any Metis?\nI currently hold a decent amount of Metis tokens and moreover I support different businesses in this ecosystem. Like I mentioned before, I\u2019m fully invested in our success.",

The thoughts I will share below are personal and come from someone who is heavily invested in Metis and its ecosystem, and someone who aims to provide as much support as humanly possible to make us succeed.\nWhat is at stake with ReGenesis?\nThere is absolutely no reason why Metis L2 cannot be among the top 3\u20135 Layer 2 solutions. With its strong history of innovation, the potential of Metis is significant\u2014and that\u2019s one of the main reasons so many people keep supporting this project. There is little recognition of this from certain communities in crypto, but Metis has been thinking of new ideas and executing them for quite some time, with alternative DAs and decentralized sequencers being prime examples of this. Now that ReGenesis is starting to be shared, I can assure you that the plan is ambitious and can certainly make Metis stand out once again. The plan targets innovative technological solutions in key growth areas that, if executed correctly, can become clear differentiators in the L2 landscape and a very attractive positioning for anyone in this industry. Considering Metis\u2019 performance so far and the fact that we are in a bull market, ReGenesis introduces an opportunity for a great comeback for our ecosystem and we must work together to ensure it is a success. In this sense, what I want to encourage here is simple: if you are a member of the community, stay connected and help builders make the most out of their products; if you are a builder, now is the time to ship. For the Metis team this works the same way, it\u2019s time to push further with more commitment and hard work. Personally, I will do my best as always and I have no doubt that we have everything it takes to succeed. ReGenesis is a unique opportunity to reset the room, act with awareness and demonstrate the great potential of Metis and its partners.\nIdentity, Storytelling and Communications:\nMetis was created to facilitate the web3 economy, and while this mission is laudable, the concrete paths are uncertain as it is a very broad vision. I\u2019m pretty sure if you ask people what Metis is about and what their core narrative is, you\u2019ll struggle to find strong coherence because a clear identity and narrative hasn\u2019t been forged yet. Note that this is not an easy task, and that ReGenesis also provides an opportunity to help craft this. I think what Elena shared earlier about important questions that can help define Metis should be taken with deep consideration (link). I\u2019ll provide my personal view on this at the end of this post. I encourage everyone who truly cares about Metis to take the time and share about this.\nNow let\u2019s talk about communications, which is the most important thing that needs to be fixed as soon as possible. It doesn\u2019t matter if Metis has great technology if it doesn\u2019t communicate effectively and get enough support and engagement from the community. The situation with the announcement of an announcement and \u201cnext week\u201d are at this point painful memes. Solving these problems requires active listening and direct execution. The former allows you to truly understand the sentiment behind what is being shared, while the latter involves avoiding generating too many expectations and demonstrating effectiveness with results. If I were to approach this from the perspective of community members alone, I can say that there is still no clear communication and there is too much information shared that doesn\u2019t really say anything. Based on this, I have personally shifted my focus to increasingly focus on the builders and the support I can provide them. This is the only thing I can do to generate results within the limited position I am currently in, and I\u2019d also like to reiterate my willingness to help solve these problems as someone who has already been able to demonstrate results in these areas.\nSince all of this involves marketing one way or another, I\u2019ll finalize this part with three suggested action points:\nNo more endless farming campaigns that are not relevant, but fewer high-impact, well-planned and communicated campaigns that really generate excitement in the community because they can see and feel how they can win.\nShifting the focus of the Metis L2 account from constantly promoting projects to sharing the story of how we are going to thrive in the web3 economy together with ReGenesis, there may be an ecosystem section or account focused on highlighting our builders and their projects. Highlight the people building Metis.\nStop focusing only on sharing content for exactly the same crowd in X, amplify the message beyond that and consider efforts in other relevant platforms such as YouTube. It\u2019s not a secret that this can yield good results during a bull market. Metis should be seen as part of the L2 mainstream and Ethereum ecosystem.\nBuilders and ReGenesis:\nSomeone shared with me a comment that I found hard to digest: there are two Metis, one for insiders and one for builders. Insiders were meant to be the group of projects and builders that have preference and \u201cextra\u201d support from Metis, and builders are the rest. I must say that I was not happy to hear that since from my perspective I do my best to help all projects no matter what. That being said, there will always be people who think differently, and if you reflect and zoom out, Metis L2 is part of a larger group of companies that are part of the Metis Foundation, who are the final decision-makers and have their own vision on everything that is going on and where we should go next. ReGenesis should not be about promoting this division, but rather an opportunity to unify our efforts to achieve great results together. Needless to say, there are builders at different stages who need different types of support, but we must remain aligned on the main mission of onboarding new users and community members to our ecosystem. Nothing else matters, and I doubt that the founders have a different stance on this. For this reason, going forward I will make sure to continue to provide as much support and visibility as possible to each of the developers and entrepreneurs in our ecosystem, no matter what stage they are at. As long as they bring value to Metis and are ethical people, I will put everything I have into helping them succeed. We can always support our native builders while also bringing some of the more established ones into our ecosystem. ReGenesis is an opportunity to harmonize and find this balance.\nI know this is a long post, but I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how to improve Metis from my current position and how to raise some valid points while also acknowledging the good work that\u2019s been done so far and some of the real support that\u2019s been provided by the community. Once again, I\u2019m confident that we can leverage ReGenesis to take Metis to new heights - this is something our community deserves.\nQuestions from Elena and my answers:\nWhat are you looking for from the Metis Network?\nI\u2019m looking for something unique that sets it apart from all the other L2s. The unique people who are already contributing and the overall vision we have are good for me, but more coherence and alignment is needed with all the relevant stakeholders: the community, the team, and leadership.\nWhere do you see yourself in this Metis Web3 Economy?\nI see myself as a facilitator, which means I will do whatever I can to encourage progress in this area and onboard more people in this world. Content, mentoring, education, and community are some of my main areas of support.\nWhat do you like about Metis?\nI like that we have some passionate builders who support each other and other committed people who actually believe in something and want to improve and make something different with Metis. Like Kevin once said, Metis is an innovator, not a follower.\nWhat you don\u2019t like about Metis?\nCommunication and marketing in general are far from ideal and this needs to change. We need more clarity both with the community and internally, from the top down and vice versa. At the same time, I strongly believe that we all need to practice active listening and try to improve from there. I would say that most of the problems are already known, but the execution is unclear. Simply put, we must stop being our own worst enemy because we have everything we need to thrive.\nAnd I add more, do you hold any Metis?\nI currently hold a decent amount of Metis tokens and moreover I support different businesses in this ecosystem. Like I mentioned before, I\u2019m fully invested in our success."

                "comment": "Dear 0xQuantic,\nThank you for sharing your insightful thoughts on the current state and future direction of Metis L2. Your emphasis on identity building, storytelling, improved communication, marketing strategies, and support for builders resonates deeply with the community\u2019s aspirations.\nDefining a strong and clear identity is essential for Metis to stand out in the competitive Layer 2 space. While Metis was created to empower the Web3 economy, the specific steps to realize this vision need further clarity. A well-crafted narrative that reflects Metis\u2019s mission and values will unite the community and attract like-minded individuals who share its goals.\nClear communication connects Metis\u2019s technology with its community. Delays and unclear announcements have caused frustration, so rebuilding trust requires transparency, consistency, and realistic commitments. Marketing should focus on impactful, well-planned campaigns to boost engagement. By listening to community feedback and making improvements, Metis can strengthen its reputation and community relationships.\nThe last but not least, builders are the foundation of the Metis ecosystem. Strong support and a fair environment are key to driving innovation and growth.\nI would also emphasize the importance of education for both builders and community members. Rather than focusing on incentivizing numerous influencers, investing in Web3 and related educational initiatives will add lasting value to the entire ecosystem and attract more people from Web2.\nThank you once again for bringing this for discussion, Quantic. You have my total support in all the mentioned initiatives.\nP.S. While I don\u2019t hold a significant amount of Metis tokens, my commitment to our success runs deep as a builder and true believer in this ecosystem."

                "comment": "Questions from Elena and my answers:\nWhat are you looking for from the Metis Network?\nI am looking for METIS to support their native builders and continue to be the innovator in the L2 space. No reason for it to not have Stage 1 done already, so they can sit in the Big Boy table of L2s. Complacency isn\u2019t in METIS\u2019 culture. And thus when complacency sets in, it makes METIS look weak. If you call yourselves Trail Blazers, trail-blaze the damn trail. Do it and show us. It\u2019s why I care about METIS, it sets itself apart from other L2s.\nWhere do you see yourself in this Metis Web3 Economy?\nI see myself as a user and supporter of METIS\u2019 ecosystem. I want to use the excellent tech that METIS has to offer. Less theory, more practicality now.\nWhat do you like about Metis?\nWhile small, you can tell who is building genuinely to stay and who is here to extract and leave the eco. And with that comes genuine devs that show they care, and I want to shout out Cobi from Vesta DAO and the people at gMETIS for believing in METIS and planting their flag here. So I like that the ecosystem is small but genuine for now.\nWhat you don\u2019t like about Metis?\nWhat Quantic conveyed is excellent:\n\u201cCommunication and marketing in general are far from ideal and this needs to change. We need more clarity both with the community and internally, from the top down and vice versa.

Simply put, we must stop being our own worst enemy because we have everything we need to thrive.\u201d\nAdditionally, I want to add that whoever is in charge of marketing, they need to engage and participate in the ecosystem and with the community. If they don\u2019t know our eco, how can you market it. Bottom up, not top down.\nAnd I add more, do you hold any Metis?\nMetis and its eco are my only bags. You can call me, A METIS Maxi."

                "comment": "First, I\u2019d like to commend Quantic for such an insightful post. The emphasis on supporting genuine builders and aligning the community is inspiring. The improvements are evident, and I look forward to seeing even more consistency in this direction.\nThis is probably not the place to mention it, but I\u2019ll speak on it either way, I\u2019d like to draw attention to the Metis Africa community. To be honest, the community is currently inactive. The last official tweet from Metis Africa was on November 19, 2024, wishing Metis a happy birthday. Before that, there were hardly any posts or engagements. On Telegram, it\u2019s even less active, with the group mostly being used to share links to official Metis Spaces on X.\nI reached out late last year offering to help, but I was told the community was doing well. However, from what I\u2019ve observed, it\u2019s not active or engaging at all.\n80% of Futuris community members are Africans, and 70% of them did not know about Metis before joining Futuris. This shows the huge potential for growth if we engage the African audience the right way.\nAfrica is a fast-growing region for blockchain adoption, and Metis has the opportunity to lead the way\nConsistent Content: Regular posts and updates tailored to the African audience. This includes educational content and relatable messages to keep the community informed and engaged.\nEngaging Twitter Spaces: Hosting frequent Spaces to discuss Metis, blockchain adoption, and opportunities within the ecosystem. These will be designed to attract and retain the African audience.\nLocalized Approach: Understanding and addressing the unique needs of different African regions. Crypto adoption varies across the continent, and our messaging should reflect that.\nCommunity Events: Organizing virtual meetups and possibly local events to build a sense of belonging and ownership within the Metis Africa community.\nMetis Africa has so much potential, and with the right effort, it can become a vibrant and thriving part of the ecosystem. I\u2019m ready to dedicate my time and resources to help make this happen. Let\u2019s work together to unlock the opportunities that Africa has to offer."

                "comment": "ReGenesis: A Critical Opportunity for Metis\nBridging the Cultural Divide in Web3\nMetis is home to a diverse set of global cultural stakeholders. However, due to the emergence of a unifying Web3 meta-culture, this archaic gap is not only broadening but also amplifying in impact. What worked four years ago in terms of strategy, rollouts, and growth models no longer applies today.\nWe need to acknowledge a fundamental shift:\nBuilding for FDV, investors, and valuations is vastly different from building for users.\nThe old model of holding speculative promise gaps is outdated.\nIn today\u2019s Web3 landscape, memetic cycles act as vampire attacks on weak or unsubstantiated value promises.\nAttention and intention are no longer abstract concepts; they are value capture mechanisms that have become stronger and more widely distributed.\nEverything is happening in real time. Now. Discussions on growth strategies, governance, and critical decisions are taking place openly on X (Twitter). Meanwhile, feedback has evolved into a cultural asset\u2014one that should be harnessed rather than dismissed. Increasing and opening feedback cylces around alligned intentions IS the growth strategy. Align,harness, learn and grow with evident feedback mechanisms to capture impact/progress and accountability.\nHolding back critical information actively harms builders.\nThe idea that delaying the sequencing of information will attract speculative investors is fundamentally flawed. This approach will not work in 2025. Mismatches of communication, intention and declaration will be ruthlessly exposed by increased decentraliztion/capability and now existing reference points.\nThere are pressing questions that demand answers:\nWho are we building for?\nWhy are we building here?\nAre information, resources, and roadmaps being selectively shared to benefit only a few incubated projects?\nIs this practice negatively impacting non-incubated builders and networks?\nThere is an increasing sentiment that non-incubated builders and networks\u2014those who demonstrate quality, efficiency, impact, and potential\u2014are either ignored or perceived as a threat.\nIf we cannot bridge gaps internally within our own ecosystem, how can we expect to build external bridges with the broader Web3 community?\nIf we cannot effectively communicate a roadmap to our own community, how do we plan to convince the rest of the world?\nWhy should outsiders trust us to execute a roadmap that we ourselves struggle to articulate, communicate, or distribute?\nVast, Unrealized Potential\nMetis has immense untapped potential. Every challenge we face is an opportunity. Everything lacking presents an opportunity to do better than any other ecosystem.\nMetis is entering the broader Web3 landscape at a critical turning point, where contrasting strategic approaches and accountability structures are emerging.\nIf leveraged correctly, this moment allows us to:\nLearn from the mistakes of others/our own.\nPursue a builder-driven culture\nFoster infinite innovation and intention\nEnsure that capability and integrity back every decision\nPersonal Perspectives on Metis\nWhat are you looking for from the Metis Network?\nTo be part of a ground-up initiative focused on community building, infrastructure, culture, and innovation in Web3.\nWhere do you see yourself in this Metis Web3 Economy?\nMy role is centered on creating synergy, unlocking innovation, and building bridges\u2014both externally and internally.\nWhat do you like about Metis?\nThe purity of intention from many founders, builders, and community participants who are experimenting with new mechanisms, models, and untapped potential.\nWhat don\u2019t you like about Metis?\nThe lack of clarity in the Foundation\u2019s strategy, grants, decision-making, feedback mechanisms, and resource distribution.\nA mismatch between values and messaging/actions, which highlights evident capability gaps that limit potential.\nThe uncomfortable silences when these issues are brought up.\nA sense of surveillance rather than collaboration\u2014who is watching whom?\nAn out-of-touch reliance on tired, predictable copy-paste approaches, while truly innovative ideas remain underutilized.\nUncomfortable feeling of the ecosystem being a speculative amplification for incubated project launches and not truly open.\nDo you hold any Metis?\nMetis\u2014and its community\u2014have a frustrating grip on my heart.\nFinal Thoughts\nMetis stands at a defining moment. We have all the tools, talent, and vision to thrive\u2014but only if we choose to address these challenges head-on with transparency, innovation, and real execution.\nReGenesis should be the turning point where we stop repeating past mistakes and start leading Web3 with an adaptive, community-driven, and innovation-first approach."

You can sell yourself when you don\u2019t know what you are.\nBeen in core social contributor in the ecosystem since 2021, and have seen Metis transition into different narratives/take up diff identities - onboarding web2 businesses (DACs), DeFi chain, \u2018best tech\u2019 (hybrid rollup) etc and now is even hard to talk socially about without looking aimless. Then the trial and errors of chasing trends, only to still be late to them, and also the stress of building on the network as I\u2019ve always heard Devs complain on how \u2018complicated/incomplete\u2019 the tech infra is to deploy and launch even basic tokens (this particular reason is why I love the new roadmap to upgrade the network and become full EVM compatible, only that then we\u2019d have better edge than other L2s with the deSeq and other specs)\nI really do hope things turn around for the better and we head back to the top .\nSigned.

This way we cover development cost and we can scale the project according to the flow of development.\nUtilization of Grant:\nStage one:\nSupport to our technical team 80%\nCover expenses on API, SDK 10%\nDevOps: servers, hostings, credits 5%\nAI tools 5%\nStage one:\nTechnical Team 60%\nToken Launch, AMM + listing 30%\nAI tools * DevOps 10%\nTeam\nMosh: Senior DLT engineer.\nHaseeb: QA, Full Stack Dev\nOtx: Full Stack Blockchain and AI Developer.\nOzk: Front-end, UIUX, AI research\nHrk: Crypto AI Agent Engineer\nThe team we are proposing from this project, has extensive experience on building Launchpad, Smart Contracts, DApps, Web3 infrastructure.\nIn 30 days we can have a working product ready to go viral.\nWe request an answer before January 20, to have some time to release the news and deploy the agent creating content by December 29 on Chinese New Year and start to get traction immediately.\nThank you for your attention and support to get to Devcon 2024.\n\u00a9 All rights reserved to ReFi Starter 2025 Stage one:\nCo"

        "content": "METIS Overhaul Proposal\nGood Morning Metisians!\nI have been asked to voice my concerns regarding recent events and the overall health of the network, with the intent to provide constructive criticism and suggest improvements. I have been active on METIS for almost four years, and it has been a journey filled with both highs and lows. As a project founder and investor in METIS, I have discussed the state of the network with colleagues and friends, and we share similar opinions on the urgent changes needed. While we all recognize the excellence of METIS technology, the execution and strategy for attracting users to this technology have been lackluster. This proposal aims to bring attention to key issues and provide the METIS Foundation with a clearer understanding of community sentiment.\nCommunity Sentiment\nOverall, community sentiment for METIS is at an all-time low. Some early adopters are even considering leaving the network. While the situation is not beyond repair, we must first identify the root causes of these issues. Greater accountability, closer supervision, and a more hands-on foundation team are crucial to reversing this trend.\nCommunication\nCommunication has been a persistent challenge for METIS since its inception, and it has not improved in recent months. Effective communication must be steady, concise, and provide a clear vision for METIS\u2019s future. This includes updates on new integrations, roadmaps, technical documentation, and input from the METIS founders. We need to be proactive and professional, with all communication prepared and scheduled ahead of time. Currently, it feels like we are constantly scrambling to produce content. Establishing a robust communication system and enforcing accountability are essential steps forward.\nMarketing\nMETIS has suffered from inconsistent marketing, largely due to the absence of a Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). Filling this role must be a top priority. The focus should shift to user acquisition rather than promoting lesser-known protocols.\nPreviously, METIS\u2019s marketing strategy emphasized promoting projects on METIS rather than the network itself. While this exposure benefits native projects, it must be approached with caution to avoid undue risk.\nKey Marketing Questions:\nWhy choose METIS to build?\nWhy choose METIS to invest?\nWhy is METIS better than 500 other Layer 2 blockchains?\nThese questions should form the foundation of any marketing campaign. Leveraging Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) and strategic mentions in videos has been effective in the past, but such efforts yield the best results during favorable market conditions.\nStrategy\nThe overall strategy for METIS appears unclear. While there is a focus on attracting DeFi protocols and projects, the network lacks adequate tooling to support developers and encourage collaboration.\nGrants, a core aspect of any successful ecosystem, have been mismanaged previosly. Many recipients of METIS grants show little interest in the community, often taking the funds and leaving without contributing value. This approach has angered the community. Instead, grants should be used strategically to build infrastructure that attracts users. Big names will follow once users are on-chain.\nProposed Infrastructure Investments:\nTools for Analytics & On-Chain Data\nLayer Zero Tools\nOff-the-shelf React components and on-chain integrations (e.g., Base\u2019s resources for developers)\nTutorials\nThe Base network\u2019s developer resources provide an excellent model: https://www.base.org/build.\nBusiness Development\nThe culture and effectiveness of the business development team need urgent review. Numerous builders report frustration with METIS\u2019s lack of support for grassroots projects. It\u2019s unclear whether this stems from a lack of authority or competence within the team.\nMETIS has repeatedly opted to hire or fund external entities rather than supporting homegrown projects. This strategy is counterproductive. Large companies will not care about METIS unless we have users. Every expenditure should bring tangible value to the network.\nFocusing on core projects, as Fantom did with SpookySwap and TOMB, can attract attention and drive growth. Incentives, such as those offered during HUMMUS\u2019s tenure, should be reintroduced and directed to existing protocols on METIS. Incentives are the fuel for DeFi growth and must be reignited.\nAirdrops\nThe mishandling of airdrops has severely damaged METIS\u2019s reputation. Both the \u201cHelmet\u201d and \u201cLayer 2\u201d airdrops were poorly executed, leading to widespread dissatisfaction. The first airdrop overpromised and underdelivered, angering participants. The second airdrop\u2019s year-long quest cost $40-50, and the reward didn\u2019t even cover the cost of entry, prompting the derogatory trend \u201c#SCAMMETIS\u201d on Twitter. Such missteps are unacceptable.\nConclusion\nWhile METIS faces significant challenges, it also has immense potential for recovery and growth. However, urgent changes are needed. Difficult decisions must be made to steer the network back on track. These concerns represent my views and those of other METIS builders and investors who believe in the need for immediate action.\nPlease sign below if you support this call to action:\nYours Truly,\nAC",

                "comment": "Identity (or lack there of) is the biggest issue.\nWhen Metis launched it had a strong identity, striving to create a comprehensive infrastructure for web2 businesses so that they could make a transition to web 3. Has a single web2 business been on boarded?\nNow Metis seems to drift aimlessly after metas. They decided to go all in on memes 6 months too late, and (as anyone paying attention predicted) it is dead on arrival.\nI spoke a while ago on another post about Metis seeming to take the wrong message From the success of memes. Memes do well because they are fun and easy to understand.\nNothing about Metis is fun or easy to understand. They seem obsessed with the 2020 playbook of vague announcements about how great things are about to be, rather than just delivering.\nI think a primary step the Metis team needs to take is to decide what it is they want to be, what is Metis \u201cBest\u201d at?\nRight now what is any user meant to shill about it?\n\u201cThere\u2019s decentralised sequencers, and I know you don\u2019t know what that means but trust me it\u2019s cool and you can farm some defi rewards just like on every other L2\u201d\nHardly a convincing sales pitch."

                "comment": "Well said, AC. It\u2019s refreshing to see someone voice concerns many of us have quietly shared. However, amidst all these critical points, one thing remains clear: METIS has some real builders and advocates who deserve proper recognition.\nLet\u2019s be real\u2014while some folks rely on bots to create a fa\u00e7ade of activity, there are genuine builders and advocates working tirelessly to onboard users, provide value, and push METIS forward without shortcuts. These individuals dedicate their time, effort, and resources to the ecosystem but are often overlooked. A little appreciation for those bringing organic growth wouldn\u2019t hurt.\nAC nailed it on the inconsistent marketing and lack of strategic focus. The absence of a clear vision\u2014one that makes developers, investors, and users see METIS as the obvious choice\u2014is glaring. And yes, marketing a network means marketing the network. Let\u2019s address the \u201cwhy METIS\u201d questions head-on, with real answers backed by action.\nAlso, let\u2019s not forget the airdrop debacles. They weren\u2019t just mismanaged\u2014they were PR nightmares. Misaligned expectations and poor execution hurt trust, and trust takes ages to rebuild.\nThat said, METIS\u2019s tech is undeniably excellent, and the potential is massive. The grants program, if used strategically, could be a game-changer for building necessary infrastructure and empowering real contributors. Let\u2019s look at the Base model for inspiration.\nDespite these challenges, I\u2019d like to thank METIS for staying the course. The network has weathered storms, and many of us are still here because we believe in its long-term potential. But let\u2019s focus on rewarding and uplifting genuine contributors and advocates\u2014not just during bull runs, but consistently.\nIt\u2019s time to rebuild trust, clarify strategy, and let actions speak louder than words. The road to redemption is clear\u2014now it\u2019s about walking it."

I aim to shape a governance model for a community that genuinely cares, and this post highlights that Metis indeed has such a community.\nHere\u2019s the message sent to the Ivory Tower . Please let me know if anything is missing:\nBelow is a concise overview of what the original post and all subsequent replies are collectively asking from the Metis team, and why these requests are being made.\nWhat Is Being Requested\nClearer & More Frequent Communication\nLeadership Visibility: Community members want direct engagement from Metis founders and senior team members (e.g., Tom, Kevin, etc.), not just from Elena.\nProactive Updates: Calls to share roadmaps, progress on technical features, clear timelines (e.g., \u201cstage 1/2 decentralization\u201d), and not just hype or vague \u201csoon\u201d announcements.\nOpen Dialogue: Many want leaders to \u201ccome down from the ivory tower\u201d to field questions, address grievances, and acknowledge community feedback\u2014rather than banning critics as \u201cFUD.\u201d\nDefined Identity & Strategy\nPurpose & Narrative: Originally, Metis pitched itself as a platform to onboard web2 businesses, but that focus shifted multiple times (DeFi, memes, AI, etc.). The community wants Metis to decide what it\u2019s truly best at and articulate that consistently.\nMarketing Alignment: Instead of marketing numerous small projects, focus on marketing Metis itself\u2014answering the \u201cWhy Metis?\u201d question (vs. other L2s) with clear selling points.\nBetter Ecosystem Support & Grant Management\nQuality Over Quantity: Criticism that grants have gone to projects that take funds without contributing back. The community wants grants focused on essential infrastructure (analytics, dev tools, tutorials) and genuine projects that drive user growth.\nSupport for Real Builders: Grassroots builders feel unsupported. They seek tangible resources, guidance, and promotional help that lead to sustained on-chain activity.\nImproved Airdrop & Campaign Execution\nRebuild Trust: Prior airdrops (e.g., \u201cHelmet,\u201d \u201cLayer 2\u201d) were poorly managed\u2014costly for participants, with minimal rewards\u2014damaging Metis\u2019s reputation. The community requests more transparent, fair, and compelling incentive programs.\nAvoid PR Pitfalls: Future campaigns must align expectations with actual outcomes to avoid negative social media backlash.\nCommunity Involvement & Respect\nNo Banning for Concerns: Multiple members say they were banned or labeled as \u201cFUD\u201d for raising issues. They want constructive criticism welcomed, not silenced.\nAppreciation for Loyal Contributors: Some folks have invested large sums of money and time to build on Metis. They want recognition and consistent support rather than feeling ignored or dismissed.\nWhy These Requests Are Being Made\nLow Morale & Trust\nThe community and longtime supporters have grown frustrated by repeated \u201cbig announcements\u201d that underdeliver, inconsistent communication, and a lack of tangible progress. Some have sold their holdings, citing a sense of relief at walking away.\nMultiple missteps (e.g., badly run Gitcoin campaigns, fraudulent projects getting spotlighted) have eroded confidence in Metis\u2019s leadership and ecosystem vision.\nMissed Opportunities & Unclear Value Proposition\nDespite Metis\u2019s strong underlying technology, it is overshadowed by an inability to convey why developers or investors should choose Metis over other Layer 2s.\nRapidly changing narratives (memes, AI, DeFi, web2 onboarding) without clear follow-through leaves builders confused about what Metis stands for.\nDesire to See Metis Succeed\nMany in the community still believe in Metis\u2019s long-term potential and want to help. They offer marketing services, introductions to reputable projects, and developer expertise\u2014if the team is willing to listen.\nThey see \u201cfixing communication and direction\u201d as the first step to unlocking the passion and talents of existing community members who can help Metis grow.\nNeed for Tangible Results\nVague promises and broad-brush marketing are less effective now, especially during tougher market conditions. The community wants action\u2014solid roadmaps, functional infrastructure, real user acquisition, and an ecosystem that people can rally around.\nKey Takeaway\nIn short, the Metis community believes in the technology\u2019s potential but urgently wants real direction, open dialogue, consistent marketing of Metis itself, better-managed incentives, and recognition of genuine contributors. They feel the foundation\u2019s failure to communicate openly, set a clear identity, and deliver on promises is driving away loyal supporters and damaging Metis\u2019s reputation. The collective message is simple:\n\u201cWe\u2019re still here because we believe Metis can succeed. Please engage us, be transparent, pick a direction, and show us real progress. We\u2019re ready to help\u2014but you have to meet us halfway.\u201d\nNow, as you requested\nnot just hype or vague \u201csoon\u201d announcements\nI wish to provide answers before the ETHDevner but it may happen right after as the team will have an opportunity to make final adjustments during in-person events.\nThat being said - if we will be able to respond to some of the questions sooner - we will post it sooner.\nI would like to thank you for the post and all the discussions around it!"

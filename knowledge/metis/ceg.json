Students and educators face the challenge of a rigid system that doesn\u2019t adapt to diverse needs, impacting learning outcomes.\nSolution Overview\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform offers a dynamic solution by employing a multi-agent system built on the Alith Agentic Framework. Specialized AI agents collaboratively analyze individual learning styles, curate tailored content, provide adaptive tutoring, and track progress in real time. This creates a uniquely personalized learning journey that adjusts to each student\u2019s needs and pace. By integrating diverse educational resources, the platform aims to enhance engagement, improve learning outcomes, and empower both students and educators.\nProject Description\nThis platform is designed to benefit a wide range of users across the educational landscape. Students of all ages, from kindergarten through higher education, can experience a more engaging and effective learning journey tailored to their specific needs. Educators can utilize the platform to enhance their teaching capabilities, gain deeper insights into student progress, and free up time for more individualized support.\nOn-Chain Components: A First-Class Implementation and Core Requirement for Blockchain Deployment\nOur AI-powered personalized education platform is not merely \u201cblockchain-enhanced\u201d \u2014 its core functionality and unique value proposition depend fundamentally on blockchain deployment via Hyperion. The decentralized, trustless, and immutable nature of blockchain\u2014particularly Hyperion\u2019s AI-optimized environment\u2014is essential to realizing our vision.\nVerifiable and Immutable Learning Profiles (On-Chain Data Storage)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain:\nStudent learning profiles\u2014containing hashed learning milestones, verified skills, and personalized path progress\u2014are recorded on Hyperion\u2019s MetisDB. Each profile includes:\nA unique student identifier\nImmutable logs of achievements\nReferences to off-chain AI agent interactions and curated learning content\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nTrustless Verification:\nCentralized educational records are prone to tampering and lack transparency. On-chain profiles offer tamper-proof, auditable records of a learner\u2019s journey\u2014verifiable by students, employers, and academic institutions alike.\nData Sovereignty:\nStudents retain full control of their learning data. On-chain metadata ensures ownership and transparency, unlike siloed centralized platforms.\nFoundation for AI Credentialing:\nImmutable learning progress forms the backbone for future AI-driven credentialing systems. AI-generated content, assessments, and learning paths can be reliably tied to a verifiable blockchain record.\nDecentralized Agent Coordination and Trust (Smart Contract Architecture)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain:\nAgent Registry & Capabilities:\nAll core agents (e.g., Learning Style Analyst, Content Curator, Personalized Tutor) are registered via smart contracts, with:\nUnique IDs\nDefined roles and permissions\nClear scope of data access and processing\nService Agreements & Orchestration Logic:\nSmart contracts manage agent workflows. For example:\nCompletion of a module may trigger the Progress Tracker\nUpon validation, the Personalized Tutor recommends next steps\nIncentive Mechanisms:\nToken-based rewards for learning milestones, community engagement, and future decentralized agent marketplaces.\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nTrustless Agent Interaction:\nIn a multi-agent system, blockchain ensures agent behaviors and interactions are transparent, verifiable, and not reliant on a centralized authority.\nGuaranteed Execution:\nSmart contracts enforce the deterministic execution of workflows, ensuring learning paths adapt in real time based on defined rules.\nImmutable Rules:\nEducational logic, access rights, and reward systems are hard-coded and transparent, fostering trust and accountability.\nAI Enablement via the Alith Agentic Framework\nWhat is Alith:\nAlith is a modular, multi-agent framework designed to power personalized learning by simulating human-like reasoning, memory, and collaboration among AI agents. It forms the intelligence layer of our platform, with deep interoperability with blockchain systems like Hyperion.\nKey Features of Alith:\nAgent Management:\nModular deployment of specialized AI agents:\nLearning Style Analyst\nContent Curator\nPersonalized Tutor\nProgress Tracker\nCollaboration Facilitator\nPersistent Memory:\nAgents maintain long-term memory and context across sessions, enhancing personalization.\nInter-Agent Communication:\nSecure and structured communication between agents, enabling dynamic, cooperative behavior.\nToolchain Access:\nSeamless access to external APIs, knowledge bases, and assessments.\nBlockchain Integration with Alith:\nOn-Chain Agent Registry:\nAll Alith agents are registered on-chain, with roles and capabilities enforced via smart contracts.\nCoordinated Workflow Execution:\nAlith agent interactions are triggered and validated by smart contracts, enabling a trustless education logic layer.\nToken-Driven Incentives:\nAgents\u2019 performance and student outcomes can be linked to on-chain reward systems to drive engagement and adaptive learning.\nPlanned Enhancements for Alith\nTo further improve the personalization, decentralization, and performance of the Alith framework, we are planning several critical upgrades:\n1. Decentralized Agent Marketplace\nAllow community developers to contribute new agents (e.g., specialized tutors or regional content curators)\nAgents will be published and authenticated on-chain with verifiable capabilities\nToken-based reputation and staking mechanisms will prevent misuse or malicious behavior\n2. Agent Fine-Tuning via Federated Learning\nSupport for secure, privacy-preserving personalization of agent behavior based on user feedback\nFine-tuning AI agents locally or within federated clusters, without compromising sensitive student data\n3. ZK-Verifiable Inference\nIntegrate zkML (zero-knowledge machine learning) to enable cryptographic verification of off-chain AI outputs\nThis allows validators and institutions to confirm an agent\u2019s decision (e.g., a test score) without exposing the underlying model or input\n4. Composable Agent Workflows\nEnable developers and educators to compose reusable learning workflows by chaining agents together via simple declarative schemas\nBacked by on-chain validation to ensure logical and pedagogical soundness\n5. Multilingual & Accessibility Agents\nCreate plug-and-play AI agents specialized in localization, translation, and neurodiverse learning strategies\nThese agents will leverage both on-chain registries and external toolchains for broader inclusion\nSecure, Real-Time AI Inference (Leveraging Hyperion\u2019s AI-Native Infrastructure)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain (or Hyperion-enabled):\nWhile most heavy AI workloads (e.g., model training, long-form inference) run off-chain via the Alith framework, Hyperion enables:\nLightweight on-chain AI inferences for rapid adaptation and scoring\nSmart contract\u2013verified AI outputs to ensure compliance with educational standards\nReal-time coordination between on-chain logic and off-chain AI services\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nVerifiable AI Outputs:\nAI-driven assessments and tutor recommendations can be validated on-chain, ensuring educational integrity and transparency\u2014unlike opaque, centralized AI systems.\nLow Latency, High Throughput:\nHyperion\u2019s parallel execution environment supports responsive, adaptive AI interactions critical to keeping learners engaged.\nScalable AI Coordination:\nIntegrating real-time AI decision-making into a decentralized, tamper-proof environment offers performance benefits without compromising trust or cost-efficiency.\nConclusion: Blockchain as the Foundation, Not a Feature\nDeploying on Hyperion transforms the platform from an advanced AI education app into a decentralized, verifiable, trust-minimized learning ecosystem. The blockchain is not an add-on \u2014 it is the bedrock of:\nTrust in student progress\nTransparency in agent interaction\nRobust, real-time AI performance\nData Sovereignty, Incentives, and Trust in Our Education Platform\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform leverages Hyperion\u2019s blockchain to give students true control over their learning data and foster a trusted educational environment.\nData Sovereignty\nWe achieve data sovereignty by giving students self-sovereign identities (SSIs) on Hyperion. Critical learning milestones and verified skills are recorded as immutable hashes on-chain (MetisDB), tied to the student\u2019s SSI. While detailed content stays off-chain, access is cryptographically linked to and controlled by the student. This means students decide who sees what data, creating a tamper-proof and verifiable record that\u2019s genuinely theirs, free from central control.\nToken Incentives\nWe use a utility token, LearnPoints ($LP), to drive engagement:\nLearn-to-Earn (L2E): Students earn $LP for completing modules, mastering skills, and consistent engagement.\nContribution Rewards: Educators and community members earn $LP for creating content, providing feedback, or participating in forums.\nStaking & Governance: $LP can be staked for premium features or used to vote on platform decisions, aligning community interests.\nThese tokens incentivize participation, build a strong community, and add tangible value to learning achievements.\nImportance of Trust and Transparency\nIn education, trust and transparency are paramount:\nLearner Trust: Students need to trust that their achievements are real and that AI decisions (like tutoring paths) are fair and unbiased. On-chain verifiable credentials and transparent AI orchestration build this crucial trust.\nEmpowering Educators: Transparent data provides educators with reliable insights into student progress and curriculum effectiveness, reducing administrative burdens and fostering accountability.\nEquity & Accessibility: Blockchain prevents fraud and offers a universal, trusted way for students to showcase skills, democratizing opportunities regardless of background. Auditable AI decisions also help mitigate bias.\nSummary\nDeploying on Hyperion transforms our platform into a decentralized, verifiable, and trust-minimized educational ecosystem. Blockchain is the bedrock enabling trust in student progress, transparency in AI agent interactions, and robust real-time AI capabilities that define our personalized learning experience.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nPeer Study Groups: Connect with others for collaborative discussions and support.\nQ&A Forums: Ask and answer subject-related questions to deepen understanding.\nSimulated Collaboration: Practice teamwork in virtual, project-based learning scenarios.\nOptional Mentorship: Receive guidance from experienced peers and educators.\nProgress Sharing (Privacy-Controlled): Share milestones to motivate peers while maintaining control over visibility.\nCommunity Challenges: Participate in gamified group activities to promote engagement and friendly competition.\nTeam Members\n@amardeep\n@priyankg3\nGitHub\ngithub.com\nGitHub - amardeepio/Eduverse\nContribute to amardeepio/Eduverse development by creating an account on GitHub.",

Agent Fine-Tuning via Federated Learning\nSupport for secure, privacy-preserving personalization of agent behavior based on user feedback\nFine-tuning AI agents locally or within federated clusters, without compromising sensitive student data\n3. ZK-Verifiable Inference\nIntegrate zkML (zero-knowledge machine learning) to enable cryptographic verification of off-chain AI outputs\nThis allows validators and institutions to confirm an agent\u2019s decision (e.g., a test score) without exposing the underlying model or input\n4. Composable Agent Workflows\nEnable developers and educators to compose reusable learning workflows by chaining agents together via simple declarative schemas\nBacked by on-chain validation to ensure logical and pedagogical soundness\n5. Multilingual & Accessibility Agents\nCreate plug-and-play AI agents specialized in localization, translation, and neurodiverse learning strategies\nThese agents will leverage both on-chain registries and external toolchains for broader inclusion\nSecure, Real-Time AI Inference (Leveraging Hyperion\u2019s AI-Native Infrastructure)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain (or Hyperion-enabled):\nWhile most heavy AI workloads (e.g., model training, long-form inference) run off-chain via the Alith framework, Hyperion enables:\nLightweight on-chain AI inferences for rapid adaptation and scoring\nSmart contract\u2013verified AI outputs to ensure compliance with educational standards\nReal-time coordination between on-chain logic and off-chain AI services\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nVerifiable AI Outputs:\nAI-driven assessments and tutor recommendations can be validated on-chain, ensuring educational integrity and transparency\u2014unlike opaque, centralized AI systems.\nLow Latency, High Throughput:\nHyperion\u2019s parallel execution environment supports responsive, adaptive AI interactions critical to keeping learners engaged.\nScalable AI Coordination:\nIntegrating real-time AI decision-making into a decentralized, tamper-proof environment offers performance benefits without compromising trust or cost-efficiency.\nConclusion: Blockchain as the Foundation, Not a Feature\nDeploying on Hyperion transforms the platform from an advanced AI education app into a decentralized, verifiable, trust-minimized learning ecosystem. The blockchain is not an add-on \u2014 it is the bedrock of:\nTrust in student progress\nTransparency in agent interaction\nRobust, real-time AI performance\nData Sovereignty, Incentives, and Trust in Our Education Platform\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform leverages Hyperion\u2019s blockchain to give students true control over their learning data and foster a trusted educational environment.\nData Sovereignty\nWe achieve data sovereignty by giving students self-sovereign identities (SSIs) on Hyperion. Critical learning milestones and verified skills are recorded as immutable hashes on-chain (MetisDB), tied to the student\u2019s SSI. While detailed content stays off-chain, access is cryptographically linked to and controlled by the student. This means students decide who sees what data, creating a tamper-proof and verifiable record that\u2019s genuinely theirs, free from central control.\nToken Incentives\nWe use a utility token, LearnPoints ($LP), to drive engagement:\nLearn-to-Earn (L2E): Students earn $LP for completing modules, mastering skills, and consistent engagement.\nContribution Rewards: Educators and community members earn $LP for creating content, providing feedback, or participating in forums.\nStaking & Governance: $LP can be staked for premium features or used to vote on platform decisions, aligning community interests.\nThese tokens incentivize participation, build a strong community, and add tangible value to learning achievements.\nImportance of Trust and Transparency\nIn education, trust and transparency are paramount:\nLearner Trust: Students need to trust that their achievements are real and that AI decisions (like tutoring paths) are fair and unbiased. On-chain verifiable credentials and transparent AI orchestration build this crucial trust.\nEmpowering Educators: Transparent data provides educators with reliable insights into student progress and curriculum effectiveness, reducing administrative burdens and fostering accountability.\nEquity & Accessibility: Blockchain prevents fraud and offers a universal, trusted way for students to showcase skills, democratizing opportunities regardless of background. Auditable AI decisions also help mitigate bias.\nSummary\nDeploying on Hyperion transforms our platform into a decentralized, verifiable, and trust-minimized educational ecosystem. Blockchain is the bedrock enabling trust in student progress, transparency in AI agent interactions, and robust real-time AI capabilities that define our personalized learning experience.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nPeer Study Groups: Connect with others for collaborative discussions and support.\nQ&A Forums: Ask and answer subject-related questions to deepen understanding.\nSimulated Collaboration: Practice teamwork in virtual, project-based learning scenarios.\nOptional Mentorship: Receive guidance from experienced peers and educators.\nProgress Sharing (Privacy-Controlled): Share milestones to motivate peers while maintaining control over visibility.\nCommunity Challenges: Participate in gamified group activities to promote engagement and friendly competition.\nTeam Members\n@amardeep\n@priyankg3\nGitHub\ngithub.com\nGitHub - amardeepio/Eduverse\nContribute to amardeepio/Eduverse development by creating an account on GitHub."

A cryptographic hash can guarantee a dataset\u2019s integrity, but it cannot verify its origin, quality, or content. A creator could claim their AI is trained on financial data when it was actually trained on irrelevant information, and the hash would still be valid.\nThis \u201csemantic gap\u201d creates a trust vacuum, preventing developers from confidently building high-stakes applications that rely on third-party AI agents.\nThe Solution\nHaithe is a trust protocol that solves this problem by creating a transparent, verifiable ecosystem for AI. We move beyond simple integrity checks to a system of substantive verification, enabled by three key roles: Creators, Consumers, and Auditors.\nInstead of just registering a data hash, creators submit a detailed Claim Manifest about their dataset. Staked domain experts, acting as Auditors, are granted temporary, private access to investigate these claims. Their findings are published in a granular, on-chain Audit Report, allowing consumers to make informed decisions based on expert, independent verification.\nHow It Works: A Three-Part Ecosystem\nHaithe\u2019s workflow ensures checks and balances between all participants, with smart contracts on Hyperion orchestrating the process.\n1. The Creator: Defining the Claims\nBuild & Register: Developers use the Alith framework to build high-performance AI agents and register them on the Haithe marketplace.\nSubmit the Claim Manifest: Alongside the agent, the Creator submits a structured manifest containing specific, falsifiable claims about the training data. For example:\nSource: \u201cAPI data from Uniswap v3 on Polygon.\u201d\nDate Range: \u201cAll swaps from June 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023.\u201d\nContent: \u201cDataset contains no personally identifiable information (PII).\u201d\nSchema: \u201cIncludes columns for token_pair, amount_in, amount_out, and gas_price.\u201d\n2. The Auditor: Investigating the Substance\nStake & Qualify: Domain experts (in finance, NLP, security, etc.) stake tokens to become eligible Auditors.\nAccept the Task: An Auditor accepts an audit request, which can be funded by the Creator or a Consumer.\nInvestigate Claims: The Auditor is granted secure, time-limited, off-chain access to the private dataset. Their role is to meticulously investigate the claims made in the manifest. This requires genuine domain expertise.\nPublish the Audit Report: The Auditor submits a detailed report to IPFS, with its hash recorded on-chain. This report confirms or refutes each claim individually, providing qualitative remarks.\n3. The Consumer: Making Informed Decisions\nDiscover & Filter: Developers browse the Haithe marketplace for AI agents. They can filter for agents based on their audit status.\nReview Reports: Before subscribing, a Consumer can review the detailed Audit Report for any agent. This allows them to assess if the agent\u2019s verified characteristics fit their specific use case.\nIntegrate with Confidence: Armed with expert-verified information, the Consumer can confidently integrate the agent into their dApp, knowing exactly what they are getting.\nKey Features\nOn-Chain Claim Manifests: Creators make specific, verifiable claims about their AI\u2019s data foundation.\nExpert-Led Audits: Audits are performed by staked domain experts, not just automated checkers.\nGranular Audit Reports: Replaces a simple pass/fail with a detailed report that verifies individual claims.\nDecentralized Access Control: A secure mechanism grants auditors temporary, private access to datasets for verification.\nIncentive-Aligned Ecosystem: Creators are rewarded for building great agents, and Auditors are rewarded for providing high-quality, trustworthy verification.\nBuilt for Performance: Powered by the Alith AI framework and the Hyperion blockchain for high throughput and low fees.\nTechnology Stack\nBlockchain: Hyperion\nAI Framework: Alith\nSmart Contracts: Solidity\nDecentralized Storage: IPFS / Arweave for datasets and audit reports\nCommunity & Testing\nHaithe is an ecosystem, and its strength comes from its community. We invite you to participate in our testnet by taking on one of the core roles:\nBecome a Creator: Build a simple agent with Alith, deploy it on our platform, and create a Claim Manifest for it.\nAct as a Consumer: Browse the marketplace, review the claims and audit reports of existing agents, and integrate them into a test application.\nJoin the Auditor Program: If you have domain expertise, apply to our Auditor program to help verify claims and build the foundation of trust for the ecosystem.",

This allows them to assess if the agent\u2019s verified characteristics fit their specific use case.\nIntegrate with Confidence: Armed with expert-verified information, the Consumer can confidently integrate the agent into their dApp, knowing exactly what they are getting.\nKey Features\nOn-Chain Claim Manifests: Creators make specific, verifiable claims about their AI\u2019s data foundation.\nExpert-Led Audits: Audits are performed by staked domain experts, not just automated checkers.\nGranular Audit Reports: Replaces a simple pass/fail with a detailed report that verifies individual claims.\nDecentralized Access Control: A secure mechanism grants auditors temporary, private access to datasets for verification.\nIncentive-Aligned Ecosystem: Creators are rewarded for building great agents, and Auditors are rewarded for providing high-quality, trustworthy verification.\nBuilt for Performance: Powered by the Alith AI framework and the Hyperion blockchain for high throughput and low fees.\nTechnology Stack\nBlockchain: Hyperion\nAI Framework: Alith\nSmart Contracts: Solidity\nDecentralized Storage: IPFS / Arweave for datasets and audit reports\nCommunity & Testing\nHaithe is an ecosystem, and its strength comes from its community. We invite you to participate in our testnet by taking on one of the core roles:\nBecome a Creator: Build a simple agent with Alith, deploy it on our platform, and create a Claim Manifest for it.\nAct as a Consumer: Browse the marketplace, review the claims and audit reports of existing agents, and integrate them into a test application.\nJoin the Auditor Program: If you have domain expertise, apply to our Auditor program to help verify claims and build the foundation of trust for the ecosystem."

We hadn\u2019t even tried Zealy, and didn\u2019t spend that $240 to get users. Everything you see here is purely community-sourced \u2014 from X and Telegram only\nJust one week after receiving our $300 kickstart fund at 30th July + a sponsor, we\u2019ve already achieved:\n100K+ impressions\n500+ new followers on X\n250+ new followers on Zealy\n500+ referral invites to the Metis Forum\nNormal Audit Score\n75K+ views on our top post\nAverage posts now getting 1K+ views\n500+ testnet transactions within 24h post-release (it count even more if we include our older contract used for private testing, but we replaced it for public launch due to low matchmaking pool and removed waiting room) Should be increased after yesterday 6th Aug\n\u2026and we\u2019re just getting started\nFeel free to validate from the screenshots \u2014 and of course, Team Metis has analytics access too\nMost of our traffic is coming from:\nVietnam - 30%\nIndonesia - 8%\nAustralia - 2%\nEurope - 5%\nUnknown from Zealy - 55%\nOur founder @0xdellwatson literally traveled across Ho Chi Minh, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Medan, Hanoi, Bali \u2014 telling people about our projects across We also have projects from other blockchain, this is really good to make community exposure, so we can easily share Metis project with web3 audience.\nWe still have no clue how Zealy\u2019s algorithm works, and might use bots \u2014 but I can\u2019t confirm, Only admin can, and we know this forum can track IP and block bots. So it\u2019s good for us too to filter out and tracking properly our traction across platforms. We just do our job and only shared the link. Getting genuine referrals is tough too if community don\u2019t know or trust you. But we learned a lot here.\nRoughly 10% of a group usually converts. For example, I shared it in a Bali group with 400+ members \u2014 only 40+ joined. You really need to be part of the community first, not just shill.\nStill \u2014 we hit 100K impressions in a week, and 1000+ transactions in a single day.\nBefore this campaign, we met CMOs people and consultants from other projects \u2014 tons of insights. Many are trying to crack Web3 traction strategies. One bold prediction I came across: Vietnam may lead APAC in Web3 community strength due to population, their tech-knowledge and traction.\nWe also learned what type of content drives engagement. We\u2019ll use that knowledge to run more viral campaigns and keep momentum going\nFun fact: we haven\u2019t even launched to the CrazyGames community yet! Once our game goes live there, you\u2019ll see organic traction. Players who love the game and get stuck in the ecosystem will happily complete tasks \u2014 especially when there are rewards or it costs nothing. You know how people watch ads just for one more gacha chest, right?\nBut we\u2019ve noticed this: Degens vs Gamers = different behaviors.\nDegens? They jump across platforms easily.\nGamers? They prefer to stay in-game.\nSo our next big step is integrating Zealy/quests via API directly into the game.

We\u2019ve built a community since testnet \u2014 now it\u2019s time to expand beyond Web3.\nFor example, I have cousins with a 1M TikTok audience. We could leverage that \u2014 it\u2019s free! But their followers aren\u2019t Web3-native. So we waited. That delay helped us realize: timing > reach. But it also gave us confidence that we have options when the time is right.\nOf course, marketing needs funds Even $300 wasn\u2019t enough to open Galxe or fully run Zealy (it costs $240 to unlock public quests ).\nThanks to our sponsor and self-funding, we\u2019ve increased the reward pool to guide and grow the community.\nNow imagine the impact once we bring in real KOLs and full readiness. This is just the beginning\nWithout this marketing challenge, we wouldn\u2019t have started seriously. But now? We\u2019re all-in. No more half-baked attempts\nSo thank you for lighting the fire\nLet\u2019s keep building.

Manual trading is emotionally taxing, requires constant market monitoring, and demands technical analysis skills many users lack. Additionally, traders struggle to maintain consistent strategies, often shifting approaches based on emotion rather than data, leading to suboptimal results.\nSolution Overview\nLazaiTrader is an intelligent multi-agent trading system accessible through Telegram that allows users to select specialized AI trading personas, each with distinct strategies and risk profiles. The system continuously analyzes market conditions and either generates actionable buy/sell signals or automatically executes trades across major DEXs based on user preference. Built on the same robust Alith framework infrastructure, LazaiTrader adapts to market conditions while maintaining the user\u2019s selected trading philosophy, effectively bringing institutional-grade trading strategies to retail users through a familiar messaging interface.\nProject Description\nLazaiTrader transforms crypto trading by allowing users to select from various AI trading personas, each representing different trading philosophies and strategies. Whether you prefer momentum trading, swing trading, technical analysis, or contrarian approaches, LazaiTrader provides a suite of specialized AI agents to match your preferred style.\nCore features include the \u201cPersona Selection\u201d system allowing users to choose trading philosophies that match their temperament, \u201cStrategy Visualization\u201d showing potential entry/exit points before execution, and \u201cDual-Mode Operation\u201d offering either signal-only notifications or fully automated trade execution. The system leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) technology and the Alith framework to maintain coherent understanding across interactions, remembering user preferences, portfolio composition, and past decisions.\nThe platform is designed to integrate with major DEXs like Uniswap v3 and can adapt to available liquidity sources. Our algorithms move beyond traditional indicators like moving averages which might not be as reliable in volatile crypto markets. Instead, we use momentum-based strategies that capitalize on emerging trends before they become obvious, volatility-adaptive approaches that dynamically adjust position sizes based on market conditions, and liquidity flow analysis to identify smart money movements before price reacts.\nUsers can select specific asset-focused strategies including Blue Chip Trader (focusing on BTC, ETH, METIS and other established cryptocurrencies) or Micro Cap Trader for those seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in emerging tokens. Each persona combines these strategy elements differently based on their trading philosophy.\nUsers interact with the system through a natural, conversational interface that explains complex trading strategies in accessible terms tailored to each user\u2019s demonstrated technical understanding. What makes LazaiTrader particularly valuable is its recognition that bull markets favor active trading strategies rather than passive yield farming approaches, allowing users to capitalize on market momentum through their preferred trading style. The system even suggests transitioning to yield strategies when market indicators suggest bearish conditions ahead, providing a complete crypto asset management solution.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nPersona Selection (50 points): Users select their first trading persona and complete the initial risk assessment. No wallet connection required at this stage.\nFirst Trading Signal (100 points): Users receive their first trading signal through the platform. All signals are recorded server-side for performance tracking even without wallet connection.\nWallet Connection (75 points): Users connect their wallet for additional features and functionality.\nRisk Adjustment (50 points): Users modify their risk parameters and observe how their trading persona adapts.\nReferral Program (25 points per referral): Users earn points by inviting others, with bonus points when referred users complete their first trade.\nTrading Performance Achievements (variable points): Users unlock badges and points when their strategies reach specific ROI thresholds.\nThis gamification approach creates clear milestones for users while educating them about different trading methodologies.

Additionally, these games are platform-locked (Uno mobile only works on mobile devices) and require downloads, installations, and updates that create accessibility barriers. Meanwhile, existing \u201cGameFi\u201d projects claiming to be on-chain still rely on off-chain servers for actual multiplayer gameplay, only tokenizing surface-level assets as NFTs. Current fully on-chain games sacrifice real-time responsiveness, creating frustrating delays that break the flow of competitive card gaming.\nSolution Overview\nBOLTIS delivers the first truly decentralized, real-time multiplayer card game that maintains competitive speed through METIS blockchain\u2019s HYPERION rollup technology. Unlike traditional mobile games that are platform-locked and require installations, BOLTIS runs instantly in any browser on any device - desktop, mobile, tablet - without downloads or updates. Every move is transparently verifiable on-chain, eliminating concerns about rigged gameplay. Unlike other GameFi projects, the entire game logic runs on-chain with 250ms response times, proving that decentralized gaming can match centralized performance while being universally accessible.\nProject Description\nBOLTIS revolutionizes card gaming by solving trust, performance, and accessibility issues plaguing both traditional and blockchain games. Unlike Uno mobile games locked to mobile platforms with unverifiable shuffles, BOLTIS works on any device with instant browser access and every action cryptographically verified on-chain.\nUsing Three.js runtime engine, players instantly jump into decentralized multiplayer matches from desktop, mobile, or tablet without downloads. The METIS HYPERION rollup executes complete game logic on-chain with 250ms response times, proving true decentralization doesn\u2019t sacrifice performance.\nUnlike GameFi projects that only tokenize assets while running gameplay on centralized servers, BOLTIS runs everything on-chain - ensuring transparent, provably fair competition. Players engage in fast-paced, skill-intensive card battles requiring quick thinking and strategy.\nWhat excites us most is creating the first truly trustless card gaming experience more accessible than traditional mobile games. Players compete from anywhere, knowing every move is cryptographically guaranteed fair. This combination of proven fairness, universal accessibility, and addictive gameplay creates unprecedented gaming where skill determines victory, not platform limitations or hidden algorithms.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nTestable Features & Gamification:\nQuick Match (10 pts): Complete a match under 5 minutes\nTutorial Completion (25 pts): Finish skill-based tutorial\nToken Staking (50 pts): Participate in competitive room match\nCross-Device Play (30 pts): Play same account on mobile and desktop\nWin Streak (75 pts): Win 3 consecutive matches\nTransparency Check (40 pts): Verify on-chain moves via block explorer\nPerformance Test (35 pts): Document HYPERION response times\nPoints unlock exclusive card designs, tournament access, and beta rankings with potential token rewards.\nGetting Involved\nJoin the BOLTIS Community:\nAlpha Testing: Sign up for early access at our team discord Theras Labs, we won multiple cross-chain game previously and continue to build, and now we intend to build card-game to test core gameplay and provide feedback.

Current asset standards also restrict cross-protocol usage, limiting the full potential of in-game assets. Meanwhile, players face high entry barriers and fragmented utility experiences, making it difficult to engage meaningfully with their gaming assets.\nSolution Overview\nStreamNFT is a full-stack platform that unifies trading, rentals, loans, and utility into a single plug-and-play hub for game developers. It simplifies the launch and scaling of in-game asset economies. Our asset standard supports cross-protocol usage, unlocking 2x more value and enabling composable utility. For players, StreamNFT offers a seamless interface to discover and interact with their in-game assets, lowering the barriers to Web3 gaming.\nProject Description\nStreamNFT is a full-stack, chain-agnostic platform designed to unlock the full potential of in-game assets and collectibles. At its core, StreamNFT offers plug-and-play modules for trading, rentals, loans, consumables, and real-time utility, all accessible through a unified interface for both developers and players.\nGame developers can launch, manage, and monetize digital asset economies without juggling multiple third-party tools. This includes setting up in-game marketplaces, enabling time-bound rentals, offering real-time perks (e.g., XP boosts, early access), creating consumable assets (like one-time power-ups or tickets), and facilitating asset-based lending, all in just a few clicks.\nWe\u2019re building on EVM-compatible infrastructure, using modular smart contracts, dynamic metadata, and real-time indexing to ensure seamless asset tracking and interaction. The system is fully composable and supports cross-protocol utility, allowing assets to be used across protocols without being locked into one platform.\nPlayers benefit from a clean, chain-abstracted interface where they can easily explore, use, or monetize their owned assets through rentals, consumables, perks, and more, removing the usual friction of Web3 onboarding.\nWhat excites us most is the opportunity to bridge the usability gap between Web2 and Web3 games. By turning static NFTs into dynamic, interactive assets, StreamNFT empowers both developers and gamers to participate in richer, more valuable digital economies, without the technical overhead typically involved.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nUsers will be able to test and engage with a range of features on StreamNFT as part of our gamified onboarding campaign:\nTestable Features/Tasks:\nConnect Wallet \u2013 50 points\nExplore In-Game Asset Listings \u2013 25 points\nTrade an Asset (Buy/Sell) \u2013 100 points\nRent an Asset (Lend or Borrow) \u2013 100 points\nUse a Consumable Asset (e.g., XP boost) \u2013 75 points\nClaim a Perk via Utility Protocol \u2013 50 points\nList Your Own Asset \u2013 75 points\nComplete a Quest (Set of 3 tasks) \u2013 Bonus 150 points\nRefer a Friend \u2013 100 points\nPoints System & Gamification:\nEach completed action earns points that unlock badges, exclusive NFTs, and early access perks. Tasks are framed like RPG-style quests (e.g., \u201cRental Rogue\u201d for first rental or \u201cPerk Hunter\u201d for claiming a utility), tapping into players\u2019 intrinsic motivation. Real-time leaderboards drive friendly competition, while referral rewards create viral growth loops.\nHow This Drives Onboarding:\nBy turning platform exploration into a game-like experience, users are drawn into a journey of discovery. The instant gratification of earning points and rewards, combined with tangible incentives (NFTs, perks, recognition), reduces onboarding friction. This approach helps users understand and experience the full value of their digital assets, while making it fun and social.\nGetting Involved\nJoin our Discord community (DAN ( Ed3, StreamNFT )) where game developers, gamers, collectors collaborate.",

This includes setting up in-game marketplaces, enabling time-bound rentals, offering real-time perks (e.g., XP boosts, early access), creating consumable assets (like one-time power-ups or tickets), and facilitating asset-based lending, all in just a few clicks.\nWe\u2019re building on EVM-compatible infrastructure, using modular smart contracts, dynamic metadata, and real-time indexing to ensure seamless asset tracking and interaction. The system is fully composable and supports cross-protocol utility, allowing assets to be used across protocols without being locked into one platform.\nPlayers benefit from a clean, chain-abstracted interface where they can easily explore, use, or monetize their owned assets through rentals, consumables, perks, and more, removing the usual friction of Web3 onboarding.\nWhat excites us most is the opportunity to bridge the usability gap between Web2 and Web3 games. By turning static NFTs into dynamic, interactive assets, StreamNFT empowers both developers and gamers to participate in richer, more valuable digital economies, without the technical overhead typically involved.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nUsers will be able to test and engage with a range of features on StreamNFT as part of our gamified onboarding campaign:\nTestable Features/Tasks:\nConnect Wallet \u2013 50 points\nExplore In-Game Asset Listings \u2013 25 points\nTrade an Asset (Buy/Sell) \u2013 100 points\nRent an Asset (Lend or Borrow) \u2013 100 points\nUse a Consumable Asset (e.g., XP boost) \u2013 75 points\nClaim a Perk via Utility Protocol \u2013 50 points\nList Your Own Asset \u2013 75 points\nComplete a Quest (Set of 3 tasks) \u2013 Bonus 150 points\nRefer a Friend \u2013 100 points\nPoints System & Gamification:\nEach completed action earns points that unlock badges, exclusive NFTs, and early access perks. Tasks are framed like RPG-style quests (e.g., \u201cRental Rogue\u201d for first rental or \u201cPerk Hunter\u201d for claiming a utility), tapping into players\u2019 intrinsic motivation. Real-time leaderboards drive friendly competition, while referral rewards create viral growth loops.\nHow This Drives Onboarding:\nBy turning platform exploration into a game-like experience, users are drawn into a journey of discovery. The instant gratification of earning points and rewards, combined with tangible incentives (NFTs, perks, recognition), reduces onboarding friction. This approach helps users understand and experience the full value of their digital assets, while making it fun and social.\nGetting Involved\nJoin our Discord community (DAN ( Ed3, StreamNFT )) where game developers, gamers, collectors collaborate."

        "content": "Live Link: https://prototypelobbyfpoint.netlify.app/\nWe are thrilled to unveil a monumental leap in the development of Fracture Point, our upcoming tactical TPS game. While our interactive lobby prototype provides a glimpse into the player experience, the true revolution lies in the meticulously crafted on-chain smart contracts and the robust Alith Architecture that power our innovative Proof of Play ecosystem.\nThis past month has been dedicated to building the immutable bedrock of Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 capabilities, focusing on decentralized ownership, verifiable progression, and a player-driven economy.\nFracture Point: The Game Skill, Strategy, and True Digital Ownership\nFracture Point is designed as a high-octane, tactical third-person shooter that demands precision, strategic thinking, and teamwork. We are building a fiercely competitive environment where your skill and dedication are not just recognized, but are fundamentally integrated into the game\u2019s core value system.\nPrepare for:\nIntense FPS Combat: Master diverse weapon loadouts and tactical maneuvers in dynamic, high-stakes engagements.\nDeep Customization: Personalize your agents and unique \u201cvariants\u201d, making your mark on the battlefield.\nCompetitive Progression: Climb verifiable leaderboards, earn genuine rewards, and truly own your in-game achievements.\nThe Proof of Play Revolution: Rewarding Skill On-Chain\nOur commitment to Proof of Play is the defining feature of Fracture Point. This is not a concept; it\u2019s a core, on-chain mechanism ensuring that your active engagement and skillful performance directly translate into verifiable, immutable value and progression within the game\u2019s ecosystem.\nHow Proof of Play works in Fracture Point, powered by our contracts:\nVerifiable Achievements: Through the GameAchievementRegistry.sol contract (which is part of our ClaimManager system), your significant in-game achievements and progression milestones are immutably recorded on the blockchain. This provides transparent, provable recognition for your dedication and skill.\nSkill-Based Rewards: Our FPToken (FracturePoint Token), serving as XP, is minted to players based on their in-game performance (e.g., in Rift events), authorized exclusively by our trusted Alith Oracle. This ensures that rewards are earned through genuine gameplay.\nOn-Chain Progression & Badges: Your accumulated FPToken (XP) can then be burned via the ClaimManager contract to claim unique Rank Badges (ERC-721 NFTs) from the RankBadge.sol contract, signifying your seasonal achievements and skill tier. This process is entirely on-chain, making your rank verifiable and owned.\nPlayer-Driven Ecosystem: This interconnected system ensures that the game\u2019s economy and value are directly influenced and shaped by the collective activity and skilled contributions of its player base.\nThis ensures Fracture Point rewards genuine skill, time invested, and proven performance, fostering a fair, transparent, and truly player-owned gaming experience.\nOur Core Architecture: Dedicated Smart Contracts and The Alith Framework\nThe true innovation behind Fracture Point lies in its robust, interconnected smart contracts and the strategic implementation of the Alith Architecture.\n1. The Alith Architecture: Our Tailored Blockchain Game Framework\nFracture Point leverages a bespoke implementation of the Alith Architecture. This is our comprehensive, modular framework meticulously designed to seamlessly integrate blockchain technology without compromising gameplay performance. It intelligently separates:\nOn-Chain Components: Our smart contracts (FPToken, RankBadge, ClaimManager) handle critical, immutable data like XP (FPToken) balances, Rank Badge (NFT) ownership, and verifiable achievements. This ensures decentralization, security, and provable ownership. The Alith Oracle acts as the trusted off-chain authority that bridges game outcomes to on-chain actions, such as distributing XP and authorizing badge claims.\nOff-Chain Backend: High-frequency game logic, real-time matchmaking, complex physics calculations, and volatile player statistics run on a performant off-chain backend. This guarantees a smooth, low-latency, and responsive gameplay experience, unburdened by blockchain transaction times and gas costs.\nSecure Interoperability: A robust and auditable communication layer ensures seamless and secure data flow between our contracts (governed by the Alith Oracle) and the off-chain game server.\n2. Fracture Point\u2019s Core Smart Contracts (Audited & Interconnected)\nWe have successfully designed, developed, and prepared for deployment the foundational smart contracts that power Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 economy and the Proof of Play mechanics. These contracts work in concert:\nFPToken.sol (FuturePoint Token) : This ERC-20 token represents XP within the Fracture Point ecosystem. It\u2019s designed specifically for in-game progression:\nMinted by Alith Oracle: Only the designated alithOracle can mint new FPToken to players (e.g., via distributeRiftXP) based on game outcomes.\nBurned by ClaimManager: The ClaimManager contract is uniquely authorized to burn FPToken (XP) from player balances when they claim Rank Badges, creating a clear utility and economic loop.\nNon-Transferable (Player-to-Player): Significantly, direct player-to-player transfers of FPToken are disabled. This ensures FPToken remains a pure XP/progression token, preventing speculative trading and focusing its value on in-game achievement.\nRankBadge.sol (Fracture Point Rank Badge) : This ERC-721 NFT contract represents unique, season-specific Rank Badges that players can earn.\nMinted by ClaimManager: Only the ClaimManager contract is authorized to mint new Rank Badges to players, ensuring badges are earned through the proper Proof of Play mechanism.\nImmutable On-Chain Proof: Each badge is a unique NFT, providing verifiable, immutable proof of a player\u2019s achievement for a given season and rank.\nClaimManager.sol : This is the central orchestrator contract, linking FPToken (XP) to Rank Badges (NFTs) and acting as the bridge to the Alith Oracle.\nManages Badge Claims: Players claim badges via ClaimManager, which then verifies their XP balance, burns the necessary FPToken from their account, and instructs RankBadge.sol to mint the new NFT.\nSeason Management: It tracks the currentSeason, ensuring players can only claim one badge per season.\nKarma Evaluation Requests: It facilitates requests for off-chain \u201cKarma\u201d evaluations by the Alith Oracle, hinting at deeper player behavior analysis.\nAlith Oracle Integration: It designates and relies on the alithOracle for authorizing badge claims and distributing rewards based on verified game data.\nThe code for these foundational contracts and the full Alith Architecture implementation can be reviewed in our public repository: https://github.com/SUPAMAN-dev/fracture-point-hyperhack\nYou can also verify our currently deployed contract addresses on the Hyperion testnet network: https://hyperion-testnet.metisdevops.link/\nFPToken Address: 0xb4F4337A5660f42bC4D7fB735F18aB7b47E3CAf9\nClaimManager Address: 0xCc3B21510ef143F4b52f5e759C097c698F838e00\nRankBadge Address: 0xd557697c5C017d6Fdd76F778C1e2355AE3CCe15e\n(Note on GHC: While not currently on-chain, the fixed supply GHC currency, managed by multisig, will form the broader economic layer of Fracture Point. Its design ensures seamless future integration with our on-chain systems when the time is right, complementing the FPToken XP system.)\nLobby Prototype: The Player\u2019s Interactive Gateway\nComplementing this powerful blockchain backend, our functional lobby prototype provides the intuitive player-facing interface. It allows players to:\nSeamlessly navigate between game modes, customization options, and personal profiles.\nExperience a polished UI/UX that aligns with Fracture Point\u2019s futuristic theme.\nInteract with the foundational elements for future wallet integration, demonstrating how players will connect their on-chain assets to the game.\nLink to the prototype demo: https://youtu.be/aI_lQ6DcwEI\nEcosystem Interest: Strategic Offer from Plurality Web3\nAs a direct result of our development efforts during this Hyperion Hackathon, Fracture Point attracted partnership interest from leading Web3 infrastructure teams, most notably Plurality Web3, a startup pioneering embedded identity and authentication infrastructure for dApps.\nPlurality offered us a 12-month support package under their Partner Program, which includes:\n1:1 Engineering Support for seamless integration of user authentication and personalized in-game logic.\nFree infrastructure credits to cover authentication, user session tooling, and zkTLS-powered identity gating.\nUX Collaboration to co-design smooth onboarding flows without popups or clunky wallets particularly valuable for our casual-to-core player conversion goals.\nTheir outreach came after they reviewed Fracture Point\u2019s Hyperion-backed Proof of Play system and saw clear potential for adoption in competitive Web3 gaming.\nWe view this offer as both validation of our underlying architecture and a strategic complement to the low-cost, high-throughput infrastructure that Hyperion enables. These ecosystem synergies affirm that Fracture Point is not just a playable demo, but a platform being taken seriously by early infrastructure players.\nWhat\u2019s Next for Fracture Point?\nWith the core blockchain architecture, smart contracts, and the lobby interface firmly established, our immediate next steps are to integrate these powerful systems with the actual game engine to bring the full combat experience to life. This includes:\nBackend Game Logic Development: Building out the sophisticated off-chain systems for real-time matchmaking, secure player data management, and robust anti-cheat measures.\nGame Engine Integration: Connecting the lobby and backend systems to a game engine to render the immersive world and high-fidelity combat of Fracture Point.\nProof of Play Loop Refinement: Fully integrating in-game actions with our GameAchievementRegistry.sol via the Alith Oracle to ensure every skill-based action is verifiable and contributes to player progression and potential future GHC earnings.\nThis is an incredibly exciting time for Fracture Point.

We began by scaling Ethereum and have steadily expanded toward a future where blockchain and AI move together.\nTraditional L2s need upgrading. That is why we built Hyperion, our AI-optimized infrastructure layer that raises throughput and lowers latency. But infrastructure alone is not enough. To bring communities in, we must layer playability and meaningful interactions on top.\nLazAI, our application and data layer, is where playability comes alive. It makes infrastructure interactive, aligns with market demand, and builds community confidence.\nMetis is the beta ground for new bets, the place where daring ideas are tested, refined, and scaled before they shape the industry at large. As we continue this path, we must grow together, anchored by trust and clarity.\nA Toolkit for One Economy: From Settlement to Playability\nMetis\u2019s strength is in its unity. We are not scattering value into silos; we are building a connected toolkit under one economy.\nAndromeda serves as the settlement and trading layer. Hyperion expands that base with scalable compute, optimized for AI dApps that demand high throughput and low latency. Together, they form the infrastructure. On top sits LazAI, serving as the application layer, transforming this foundation into playability, points, data, and AI-driven value.\nStep by step, the toolkit expands. Value builds as the layers connect. Recent milestones show this evolution in motion. Andromeda continues as the battle-tested motherchain. HyperHack drew more than 100 active Hyperion builders. LazAI Testnet launched with Lazbubu proving real playability. Our AI Companion DAT Lazbubu enrolled over 90k participants in the Whitelist Campaign and over 10,000 DAT mints.\nPutting Users First in the Journey\nParticipation begins with simple entry points that spark curiosity. From there, users move into richer experiences where AI, data, and community features make engagement meaningful.\nThe path is clear. LazAI incubates agents and applications through LazPad, while users earn, mint, and interact with data assets that mature into broader use cases on Andromeda. Lazbubu is the first step, showing how evolving AI Companions can anchor this journey.\nThese are not static NFTs, but AI agents that evolve over time, transforming innovation into experiences that align with market demand and foster confidence within our community.\nClosing\nAs I shared in a previous letter, our strength comes from trust and clarity. The earlier you take part in these new layers, the more your participation will guide their growth, and over time your efforts may be recognized in ways that matter.\nMetis is shaping the beta ground for the next era. With clear paths for participation through LazAI and Lazbubu, and with a culture that dares while staying principled, we are ready for what\u2019s next.\nThis is not the time to stand still. This is the time to lean in, experiment, and co-create the future.\nTogether, we will make Metis not just a network but the proving ground where tomorrow\u2019s breakthroughs are born.\n\u2014 Elena Sinelnikova",

You\u2019ve just installed the Alith framework in Python.\nStep 4: Configure Your API Key\nTime to tell Alith which API key to use.\nYou can set it as an environment variable to keep it safe.\n#Mac/Linux:\nexport GROQ_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'\n\n#Windows:\nset GROQ_API_KEY \"your-api-key-here\"\nOr even better \u2014 use a .env file for simplicity.\nInside .env, just add:\nGROQ_API_KEY=your-api-key-here\nStep 5: Write a Simple Alith Example\nLet\u2019s make Alith do something \u2014 like tell us a joke\nCreate a new file called alith_joke.py and paste this code:\nfrom alith import Agent\nimport os\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\nload_dotenv()\napi_key = os.getenv(\"GROQ_API_KEY\")\n\nagent = Agent(\n    model=\"llama3-70b-8192\",\n    api_key=api_key,\n    base_url=\"https://api.groq.com/openai/v1\",\n    preamble=\"You are a funny comedian who entertains the user.\"\n)\n\nresponse = agent.prompt(\"Tell me a joke about coding.\")\nprint(response)\nThis little script connects to Groq through Alith and gets a fun AI-generated response!\nStep 6: Run the Code\nNow, you can run the Python file using this command :\n#Windows\npython alith_joke.py\n\n#Mac/Linux:\npython3 alith_joke.py\nIf everything\u2019s set up right, Alith will reply with a joke like:\n\u201cWhy do Python developers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs! \u201d\nYeah, you successfully ran the Alith agent using a free api key",

                "comment": "Hey everyone ,\nI\u2019m Abishake, and in this post, I\u2019ll walk you through how to get started with Alith.\nAlright, before we jump into building something cool, let\u2019s first get the basics right.\nWe\u2019re going to cover a few simple but important steps \u2014 all hands-on!\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019ll do together\nGet your free Groq API key\nSet up your Python environment\nInstall Alith\nConfigure your API key securely\nWrite a sample Python code using Alith\nAnd finally\u2026 run it live!\nStep 1: Get Your Free Groq API Key\nTo make Alith talk with AI models, we need an API key \u2014 and Groq gives one for free\nHere\u2019s how to get it in less than a minute:\nGo to Groq\nSign up or log in\nHead over to API Keys \u2192 Generate New Key\nCopy it safely \u2014 we\u2019ll use it soon!\nTip: Don\u2019t share your API key publicly \u2014 it\u2019s like your personal password for AI access.\nStep 2: Set Up Your Python Environment\nLet\u2019s set up a clean space to code, so things don\u2019t get messy.\nFirst, create a new folder for your project:\nmkdir alith-demo && cd alith-demo\nNow, create and activate a virtual environment:\n#To double-check Python is ready:\npython --version #If you see Python 3.8+, you\u2019re good to go\n\n#Windows\npython -m venv venv\nvenv\\Scripts\\activate \n\n#Mac/Linux\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\nStep 3: Install Alith SDK\nNow the fun part \u2014 let\u2019s bring Alith into our project.\nRun this command:\npip install alith -U\nThat\u2019s it! You\u2019ve just installed the Alith framework in Python.\nStep 4: Configure Your API Key\nTime to tell Alith which API key to use.\nYou can set it as an environment variable to keep it safe.\n#Mac/Linux:\nexport GROQ_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'\n\n#Windows:\nset GROQ_API_KEY \"your-api-key-here\"\nOr even better \u2014 use a .env file for simplicity.\nInside .env, just add:\nGROQ_API_KEY=your-api-key-here\nStep 5: Write a Simple Alith Example\nLet\u2019s make Alith do something \u2014 like tell us a joke\nCreate a new file called alith_joke.py and paste this code:\nfrom alith import Agent\nimport os\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\nload_dotenv()\napi_key = os.getenv(\"GROQ_API_KEY\")\n\nagent = Agent(\n    model=\"llama3-70b-8192\",\n    api_key=api_key,\n    base_url=\"https://api.groq.com/openai/v1\",\n    preamble=\"You are a funny comedian who entertains the user.\"\n)\n\nresponse = agent.prompt(\"Tell me a joke about coding.\")\nprint(response)\nThis little script connects to Groq through Alith and gets a fun AI-generated response!\nStep 6: Run the Code\nNow, you can run the Python file using this command :\n#Windows\npython alith_joke.py\n\n#Mac/Linux:\npython3 alith_joke.py\nIf everything\u2019s set up right, Alith will reply with a joke like:\n\u201cWhy do Python developers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs! \u201d\nYeah, you successfully ran the Alith agent using a free api key"

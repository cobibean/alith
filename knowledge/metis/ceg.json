At its core, it\u2019s about building stuff, pitching in, and helping the whole developer community level up. \u201cDev\u201d stands for Developer, and that comes with real responsibility. You need to build stuff, pitch in, and try new things. The real difference you make as a Dev Ambassador comes from what you build, not just what you share online.\nA true Dev Ambassador rolls up their sleeves and gets their hands dirty. They build new features, fix bugs, try out new ideas, or tinker with things to see what works. When something clicks, they don\u2019t keep it to themselves. They write up what they learned, post tutorials, or share their story so someone else can take that knowledge and run with it.\nHere\u2019s what being a Dev Ambassador actually looks like:\nRoll up your sleeves and contribute to building features, improve open-source, and dive into real-world projects.\nTeach what you know, write tutorials, share technical articles, and create resources based on your own experience.\nStay active on GitHub, commit code, squash bugs, share cool tools, or kick off a new project.\nShare your process, write blogs, or make videos about what you\u2019ve actually built, not just what caught your eye.\nGet involved in run sessions, answer questions, mentor folks, and help the community level up.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, posting is part of the job. But it\u2019s not the whole job.\nAt the end of the day, a Dev Ambassador should be a developer first and a promoter second. Build something real, then share it so others can learn from you.

It formalizes two interlinked upgrades:\nOptimizing DSeq sustainability (20% \u2192 15%) and establishing the Ecosystem Alignment & Growth Reserve (EAGR) to power validator expansion, liquidity depth, and cross-layer participation - without new issuance or inflation.\nBackground\nCurrent State\nSince ReGenesis, Metis has operated on a consistent architectural principle: fortify the base infrastructure first, enable high-performance applications, and ensure that generated value flows back to the ecosystem. As outlined in Elena\u2019s recent letter to the community ( Metis September Monthly Roundup: Hyperion Builders Make History - Metis ), our architecture includes:\nAndromeda: Traditional EVM-compatible Layer 2 handling general settlement and foundational applications, including DeFi\nHyperion: Performance expansion layer providing elasticity for high-throughput, low-latency scenarios, including AI workloads\nLazAI: Application and data layer converting AI \u00d7 DAT scenarios into on-chain visible records that connect user actions with assetization paths\nZKM: Zero-knowledge and verifiable compute infrastructure as long-term primitives\nGOAT: Bitcoin Layer 2 exploration derived from ZKM, philosophically aligned with Metis in turning verifiable compute and real usage into network value\nThese components represent different facets of a unified ecosystem in which network value returns to the Metis ecosystem through usage-driven, on-chain-visible mechanisms.\nUnifying the Metis Ecosystem\nThe blockchain industry has seen major shifts lately. Market volatility has tested Layer 2 ecosystems, while AI\u2019s rise has created new opportunities and pressures for infrastructure builders. Communities have voiced concerns about sustainability, resource efficiency, and the need for adaptive strategies that stay true to core principles.\nMetis\u2019 approach focuses on strategic alignment rather than reactive change, bringing the other network layers into closer alignment. Its integration of AI through LazAI and verifiable compute via ZKM reflects a long-term vision of usage-driven value creation\u2014not short-term trend chasing. To realize this, Metis is refining its economic model to balance immediate incentives with long-term sustainability as it launches new network phases requiring validator and liquidity support.\nProposal Details\nA key component of ecosystem unification is establishing METIS as the native gas token for the LazAI network. This represents the first step in unifying the ecosystem, creating direct, usage-driven demand in which every AI inference, data operation, and on-chain computation requires METIS. The EAGR will provide initial gas liquidity support and mechanisms to ensure a seamless user experience during network launch.\nThe two interconnected optimizations proposed below enable this ecosystem unification while maintaining long-term sustainability:\n1. Decentralized Sequencer Mining Rewards Optimization\nCurrent Parameter: 20% annualized mining rewards rate\nProposed Parameter: 15% annualized mining rewards rate\nRationale:\nThe Decentralized Sequencer pool has matured since launch, with established participation and operational stability\nAt 15%, Metis sequencer yields remain above leading L2 averages (e.g., Base, Arbitrum validator returns <10%), ensuring continued attractiveness while improving economic runway by 25%.\nOptimizing the rate frees capital for broader ecosystem expansion and aligns incentives across upcoming network layers.\nImplementation:\nSmooth phased rollout to ensure continuity\nParameters and timeline will be determined to minimize disruption and adjusted as needed\nExisting sequencer operations remain unaffected during the transition period\n2. Establishment of Ecosystem Alignment & Growth Reserve (EAGR)\nSize: 20% of total METIS supply (reallocated from existing Mining Rewards).\nSource: Reallocation within the original tokenomics \u201cMining Rewards\u201d toward growth\nCritical Clarifications:\nNo new token issuance: EAGR represents a reallocation toward growth of already-allocated tokens\nNo change to total supply cap: The maximum METIS supply remains unchanged\nPhased release model: Tokens convert to circulating supply gradually per specific use case activation\nCommunity & Stakeholder Participation Paths & EAGR Example Use Cases (Whitelist-Based Execution):\nValidator Staking for New Network Phases\nEcosystem Liquidity Support\nTreasury Support for Ecosystem Sub-Projects\nGovernance and Execution:\nPhased release per use-case activation\nWhitelist-based allocation requiring documented usage justification\nImplementation aligned with established governance procedures\nEconomic Impact Analysis:\nTotal supply: 10,000,000 METIS \u2192 10,000,000 METIS (No change)\nCirculating Supply: Dynamic \u2192 Dynamic (Phased per use case)\nDemand-side offsets: Staking, locking, and real usage requirements create natural demand mechanisms\nInflation: None\nBenefits to the Metis Ecosystem\nFor METIS Holders:\nImproved long-term economic sustainability through balanced reward structures\nEnhanced ecosystem growth potential through strategic capital allocation\nTransparent resource management with clear accountability mechanisms\nFor Decentralized Sequencers:\nContinued competitive rewards at a 15% annualized rate\nSmooth transition, preventing operational disruption\nStrengthened overall ecosystem supporting sequencer value proposition\nFor Ecosystem Builders:\nAccess to strategic support through EAGR mechanisms for qualified projects\nValidator participation opportunities in emerging network phases\nAligned incentive structures promoting long-term ecosystem contribution\nFor the Broader Community:\nVisible commitment to sustainable growth over short-term extraction\nInfrastructure support for next-generation applications (AI, DAT, cross-chain)\nModel resilience during market volatility\nImplementation Roadmap\nPhase 1 (Upon Approval): Governance vote completion and result announcement\nPhase 2 (Within 2 weeks of approval):\nDetailed technical implementation notice for DSeq rate transition\nEAGR establishment\nPhase 3 (Within 4 weeks of approval):\nDSeq rate smooth transition initiation\nPhase 4 (Ongoing):\nValidator participation program details release\nCommunity feedback integration\nAdaptive parameter adjustments through governance as needed\nVoting Details\nProposal Type: Governance Proposal (modifies economic model parameters and tokenomics structure)\nVoting Platform: Snapshot (https://snapshot.org/#/metislayer2.eth)\nVoting Link: Governance Proposal: Metis Ecosystem Unification and Economic Model Evolution\nVoting Timeline:\nMonday, October 27: Proposal publication on governance forum, accompanying blog post announcement, and Snapshot vote initiation\nWednesday, October 29: Snapshot vote initiation\nThursday, October 30: Community Twitter Space for questions and clarifications\nMonday, November 3: Vote conclusion (5-day voting period)\nVoting Options:\nApprove (support both DSeq rate optimization and EAGR establishment)\nReject (oppose the proposed changes)\nAbstain\nQuorum Requirements: Per the governance framework for Governance Proposals\nImplementation Authority: Upon majority approval, the Metis Foundation will coordinate execution under guidance from community governance and validator feedback according to established governance procedures, with Governance Working Group oversight.\nOfficial Links\nMetis Foundation Governance Framework: Metis Foundation - Governance\nMetis Developer Documentation: https://docs.metis.io\nDecentralized Sequencer Overview: https://docs.metis.io/dev/decentralized-sequencer/overview\nCEG Governance Forum: https://forum.ceg.vote\nSnapshot Voting Platform: https://snapshot.org/#/metislayer2.eth\nDisclaimer\nThrough this proposal, Metis affirms its belief that resilience is built, not bought.

        "content": "Use Case 1: Decentralized & Verifiable Peer Review for Scientific Research\nThe Idea and Who it Helps: Imagine a system where scientific research papers are not just peer-reviewed by human experts, but also by a network of specialized AI \u201ccritique agents.\u201d These agents could check for logical consistency, statistical rigor, methodology flaws, and even attempt to reproduce results from provided datasets and code. This helps researchers get faster, more comprehensive, and less biased feedback, leading to higher quality publications.\nHow Alith SDK or DATs Make it Possible:\nMulti-Agent System: A \u201cPeer Review Orchestrator\u201d agent could assign sections of a paper to various specialized AI agents (e.g., \u201cStatistical Analyst Agent,\u201d \u201cMethodology Validator Agent,\u201d \u201cCode Reproducibility Agent\u201d). Each agent would perform its specific task, generate a report, and feed it back to the orchestrator.\nDAT Marketplaces: Researchers could submit their papers and associated data/code as DATs. Reviewer agents could \u201cbid\u201d for review tasks on a DAT Marketplace, earning reputation tokens or cryptocurrency for accurate and insightful reviews. The research paper itself, along with all review reports, could be bundled as an immutable DAT, providing a transparent and verifiable audit trail of the review process.\nAlith SDK: The SDK would facilitate the secure interaction between these agents, allowing them to access and process the sensitive research data (with appropriate access controls) and record their review actions on the blockchain.\nLimitations or Future Improvements:\nLimitations: AI agents currently lack the nuanced understanding and creative problem-solving of human peer reviewers. There\u2019s a risk of \u201csuperficial\u201d reviews if not carefully designed. Handling highly novel or interdisciplinary research might be challenging.\nFuture Improvements: Incorporate human-in-the-loop validation where human experts review the AI agents\u2019 findings. Develop more sophisticated AI agents capable of understanding context and identifying groundbreaking ideas. Integrate reputation systems that penalize agents for consistently providing poor or misleading reviews.\nUse Case 2: AI-Powered \u201cBug Bounty\u201d for Smart Contract Auditing\nThe Idea and Who it Helps: Smart contracts are prone to vulnerabilities, leading to massive financial losses. This system would create an autonomous bug bounty program where specialized AI auditing agents continuously scan smart contracts for exploits. It helps blockchain developers deploy more secure contracts and incentivizes AI security researchers.\nHow Alith SDK or DATs Make it Possible:\nMulti-Agent System: A \u201cSecurity Audit Orchestrator\u201d agent would manage a pool of various \u201cVulnerability Detection Agents\u201d (e.g., agents specializing in reentrancy attacks, front-running, gas limit exploits, access control issues). The orchestrator could distribute new smart contract code (as DATs) to these agents for analysis.\nDAT Marketplaces: Smart contract developers could publish their contract code as a DAT on a \u201cBug Bounty Marketplace.\u201d AI auditing agents would compete to find vulnerabilities. When an agent identifies a bug, it submits a \u201cproof-of-vulnerability\u201d DAT. If verified, the agent receives a bounty (e.g., in a native token or cryptocurrency) from the developer or a dedicated fund.\nAlith SDK: The SDK would enable secure submission of contract code, verifiable reporting of vulnerabilities, and automated payout of bounties upon successful verification, all recorded on-chain.\nLimitations or Future Improvements:\nLimitations: AI agents might struggle with novel attack vectors or highly complex contract logic. False positives could be an issue, requiring careful design of verification mechanisms.\nFuture Improvements: Integrate formal verification methods with AI analysis to reduce false positives. Develop \u201cexploit generation agents\u201d that can not only identify vulnerabilities but also demonstrate practical exploits. Create a feedback loop where successful exploit data is used to train and improve future auditing agents.\nUse Case 3: Collaborative Drug Discovery and Validation\nThe Idea and Who it Helps: Accelerate drug discovery by having various AI agents collaboratively explore chemical spaces, predict drug efficacy, and even simulate drug interactions and toxicity. This benefits pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, and ultimately, patients.\nHow Alith SDK or DATs Make it Possible:\nMulti-Agent System: A \u201cDrug Discovery Orchestrator\u201d agent could coordinate \u201cMolecule Generation Agents,\u201d \u201cEfficacy Prediction Agents,\u201d \u201cToxicity Simulation Agents,\u201d and \u201cClinical Trial Design Agents.\u201d Each agent contributes its specialized knowledge to the overall discovery pipeline.\nDAT Marketplaces: Researchers could contribute proprietary datasets (e.g., chemical libraries, patient data, clinical trial results) as encrypted DATs on a \u201cBiopharma Data Marketplace.\u201d AI agents requiring specific data for their tasks could access these DATs under predefined, verifiable access conditions, paying data providers for usage. Synthesized drug candidates and their predicted properties could also be published as DATs.\nAlith SDK: The SDK would manage secure, permissioned access to sensitive biomedical DATs, ensure verifiable execution of AI agent tasks, and enable transparent sharing of research outcomes and intellectual property.\nLimitations or Future Improvements:\nLimitations: The complexity of biological systems makes accurate AI prediction challenging. Ethical considerations around data privacy (especially patient data) are paramount.\nFuture Improvements: Implement federated learning approaches to train agents on decentralized datasets without directly exposing raw data. Develop \u201cexplainable AI\u201d (XAI) agents to provide transparency into drug predictions, building trust with human researchers. Integrate wet-lab robotic systems for automated physical validation of promising drug candidates identified by the agents.\n@LazAI",

False positives could be an issue, requiring careful design of verification mechanisms.\nFuture Improvements: Integrate formal verification methods with AI analysis to reduce false positives. Develop \u201cexploit generation agents\u201d that can not only identify vulnerabilities but also demonstrate practical exploits. Create a feedback loop where successful exploit data is used to train and improve future auditing agents.\nUse Case 3: Collaborative Drug Discovery and Validation\nThe Idea and Who it Helps: Accelerate drug discovery by having various AI agents collaboratively explore chemical spaces, predict drug efficacy, and even simulate drug interactions and toxicity. This benefits pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, and ultimately, patients.\nHow Alith SDK or DATs Make it Possible:\nMulti-Agent System: A \u201cDrug Discovery Orchestrator\u201d agent could coordinate \u201cMolecule Generation Agents,\u201d \u201cEfficacy Prediction Agents,\u201d \u201cToxicity Simulation Agents,\u201d and \u201cClinical Trial Design Agents.\u201d Each agent contributes its specialized knowledge to the overall discovery pipeline.\nDAT Marketplaces: Researchers could contribute proprietary datasets (e.g., chemical libraries, patient data, clinical trial results) as encrypted DATs on a \u201cBiopharma Data Marketplace.\u201d AI agents requiring specific data for their tasks could access these DATs under predefined, verifiable access conditions, paying data providers for usage. Synthesized drug candidates and their predicted properties could also be published as DATs.\nAlith SDK: The SDK would manage secure, permissioned access to sensitive biomedical DATs, ensure verifiable execution of AI agent tasks, and enable transparent sharing of research outcomes and intellectual property.\nLimitations or Future Improvements:\nLimitations: The complexity of biological systems makes accurate AI prediction challenging. Ethical considerations around data privacy (especially patient data) are paramount.\nFuture Improvements: Implement federated learning approaches to train agents on decentralized datasets without directly exposing raw data. Develop \u201cexplainable AI\u201d (XAI) agents to provide transparency into drug predictions, building trust with human researchers. Integrate wet-lab robotic systems for automated physical validation of promising drug candidates identified by the agents.\n@LazAI"

                "comment": "Introduction\nLazaiTrader is revolutionizing automated trading on Metis by combining artificial intelligence, non-custodial security, and community-driven strategy optimization. Built specifically for the Hyperion testnet (with mainnet deployment planned), LazaiTrader offers users a complete trading experience through Telegram where they maintain full control of their assets while benefiting from automated trading strategies.\nUnlike traditional trading bots that require users to hand over their private keys, LazaiTrader employs Smart Contract Wallets (SCW) that give users complete ownership while allowing the AI to execute trades only on whitelisted DEXs. This non-custodial architecture ensures users can withdraw their funds at any time, with transparent on-chain verification of all transactions.\nWhat makes LazaiTrader special? It\u2019s the first AI-powered trading assistant on Metis that combines:\nNon-custodial security (you own your wallet)\nAI-powered automation (martingale strategy optimization)\nCommunity intelligence (Strategy Vault with privacy-preserving data sharing)\nReal-time analytics (comprehensive performance tracking)\nAlith AI Support Agent (LazaiNetwork/Alith-powered customer assistance)\nValue Proposition\nFor Individual Users\nAutomated Trading Without Risk of Loss of Control:\nDeploy your own Smart Contract Wallet where YOU remain the owner\nBot can only execute trades on whitelisted Metis DEXs (Netswap, etc.)\nWithdraw your funds to your personal wallet anytime - no permission needed\nAll transactions visible on-chain for complete transparency\nIntelligent Strategy Execution:\nAutomated martingale strategy: buy low, sell high with dynamic multipliers\nAI-optimized parameters based on market conditions\nReal-time price monitoring from multiple sources (DexScreener, CoinGecko)\nConfigurable risk management with safety limits\nCommunity-Powered Improvement:\nStrategy Vault: Share your trading data (encrypted and privacy-preserving)\nGet AI recommendations based on collective community performance\nLearn from successful traders without exposing private information\nTEE (Trusted Execution Environment) ensures data privacy\nSeamless Experience:\nEverything through Telegram - no complex interfaces\nOne-command setup: /start \u2192 Configure \u2192 Start trading\nReal-time notifications for all trades\nBeautiful charts showing your performance and PnL\nFor the Metis Ecosystem\nIncreased DEX Volume & Liquidity:\nContinuous automated trading drives consistent DEX volume\nIntelligent market making through martingale strategies\nMulti-pair support increases liquidity depth across trading pairs\nHelps establish price discovery for Metis native tokens\nUser Onboarding & Retention:\nSimple Telegram interface lowers barriers to DeFi entry\nTestnet environment allows risk-free learning\nNon-custodial architecture builds trust with security-conscious users\nAI support agent (Alith) provides 24/7 assistance\nEcosystem Data Layer:\nStrategy Vault creates valuable trading analytics for Metis ecosystem\nAggregate trading data helps identify market trends\nIntegration with LazAI Network for decentralized data processing\nCommunity insights improve overall trading strategies\nDeveloper Showcase:\nDemonstrates advanced smart contract architecture on Metis\nShows potential of AI/ML integration with blockchain\nOpen-source reference implementation for non-custodial automation\nHighlights Metis capabilities for complex DeFi applications\nUniqueness Factor\n1. True Non-Custodial Automation\nMost trading bots require users to deposit funds or hand over private keys. LazaiTrader uses Smart Contract Wallets where:\nUser owns the wallet (receives the SCW contract address)\nBot operator has restricted permissions (can only trade on whitelisted DEXs)\nUser can withdraw anytime (no lock-up periods or approval delays)\nOn-chain transparency (every trade is verifiable)\nThis architecture is unique in combining automation with user sovereignty.\n2. AI-Powered Strategy Optimization\nAlith AI Agent: LazaiNetwork/Alith-powered support with GitHub documentation integration\nPersonalized Recommendations: AI suggestions based on your trading patterns\nAdaptive Parameters: Strategy automatically adjusts to market conditions\nCommunity Learning: Anonymized collective intelligence improves individual performance\n3.

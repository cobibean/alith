        "content": "Live Link: https://prototypelobbyfpoint.netlify.app/\nWe are thrilled to unveil a monumental leap in the development of Fracture Point, our upcoming tactical TPS game. While our interactive lobby prototype provides a glimpse into the player experience, the true revolution lies in the meticulously crafted on-chain smart contracts and the robust Alith Architecture that power our innovative Proof of Play ecosystem.\nThis past month has been dedicated to building the immutable bedrock of Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 capabilities, focusing on decentralized ownership, verifiable progression, and a player-driven economy.\nFracture Point: The Game Skill, Strategy, and True Digital Ownership\nFracture Point is designed as a high-octane, tactical third-person shooter that demands precision, strategic thinking, and teamwork. We are building a fiercely competitive environment where your skill and dedication are not just recognized, but are fundamentally integrated into the game\u2019s core value system.\nPrepare for:\nIntense FPS Combat: Master diverse weapon loadouts and tactical maneuvers in dynamic, high-stakes engagements.\nDeep Customization: Personalize your agents and unique \u201cvariants\u201d, making your mark on the battlefield.\nCompetitive Progression: Climb verifiable leaderboards, earn genuine rewards, and truly own your in-game achievements.\nThe Proof of Play Revolution: Rewarding Skill On-Chain\nOur commitment to Proof of Play is the defining feature of Fracture Point. This is not a concept; it\u2019s a core, on-chain mechanism ensuring that your active engagement and skillful performance directly translate into verifiable, immutable value and progression within the game\u2019s ecosystem.\nHow Proof of Play works in Fracture Point, powered by our contracts:\nVerifiable Achievements: Through the GameAchievementRegistry.sol contract (which is part of our ClaimManager system), your significant in-game achievements and progression milestones are immutably recorded on the blockchain. This provides transparent, provable recognition for your dedication and skill.\nSkill-Based Rewards: Our FPToken (FracturePoint Token), serving as XP, is minted to players based on their in-game performance (e.g., in Rift events), authorized exclusively by our trusted Alith Oracle. This ensures that rewards are earned through genuine gameplay.\nOn-Chain Progression & Badges: Your accumulated FPToken (XP) can then be burned via the ClaimManager contract to claim unique Rank Badges (ERC-721 NFTs) from the RankBadge.sol contract, signifying your seasonal achievements and skill tier. This process is entirely on-chain, making your rank verifiable and owned.\nPlayer-Driven Ecosystem: This interconnected system ensures that the game\u2019s economy and value are directly influenced and shaped by the collective activity and skilled contributions of its player base.\nThis ensures Fracture Point rewards genuine skill, time invested, and proven performance, fostering a fair, transparent, and truly player-owned gaming experience.\nOur Core Architecture: Dedicated Smart Contracts and The Alith Framework\nThe true innovation behind Fracture Point lies in its robust, interconnected smart contracts and the strategic implementation of the Alith Architecture.\n1. The Alith Architecture: Our Tailored Blockchain Game Framework\nFracture Point leverages a bespoke implementation of the Alith Architecture. This is our comprehensive, modular framework meticulously designed to seamlessly integrate blockchain technology without compromising gameplay performance. It intelligently separates:\nOn-Chain Components: Our smart contracts (FPToken, RankBadge, ClaimManager) handle critical, immutable data like XP (FPToken) balances, Rank Badge (NFT) ownership, and verifiable achievements. This ensures decentralization, security, and provable ownership. The Alith Oracle acts as the trusted off-chain authority that bridges game outcomes to on-chain actions, such as distributing XP and authorizing badge claims.\nOff-Chain Backend: High-frequency game logic, real-time matchmaking, complex physics calculations, and volatile player statistics run on a performant off-chain backend. This guarantees a smooth, low-latency, and responsive gameplay experience, unburdened by blockchain transaction times and gas costs.\nSecure Interoperability: A robust and auditable communication layer ensures seamless and secure data flow between our contracts (governed by the Alith Oracle) and the off-chain game server.\n2. Fracture Point\u2019s Core Smart Contracts (Audited & Interconnected)\nWe have successfully designed, developed, and prepared for deployment the foundational smart contracts that power Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 economy and the Proof of Play mechanics. These contracts work in concert:\nFPToken.sol (FuturePoint Token) : This ERC-20 token represents XP within the Fracture Point ecosystem.

                "comment": "Live Link: https://prototypelobbyfpoint.netlify.app/\nWe are thrilled to unveil a monumental leap in the development of Fracture Point, our upcoming tactical TPS game. While our interactive lobby prototype provides a glimpse into the player experience, the true revolution lies in the meticulously crafted on-chain smart contracts and the robust Alith Architecture that power our innovative Proof of Play ecosystem.\nThis past month has been dedicated to building the immutable bedrock of Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 capabilities, focusing on decentralized ownership, verifiable progression, and a player-driven economy.\nFracture Point: The Game Skill, Strategy, and True Digital Ownership\nFracture Point is designed as a high-octane, tactical third-person shooter that demands precision, strategic thinking, and teamwork. We are building a fiercely competitive environment where your skill and dedication are not just recognized, but are fundamentally integrated into the game\u2019s core value system.\nPrepare for:\nIntense FPS Combat: Master diverse weapon loadouts and tactical maneuvers in dynamic, high-stakes engagements.\nDeep Customization: Personalize your agents and unique \u201cvariants\u201d, making your mark on the battlefield.\nCompetitive Progression: Climb verifiable leaderboards, earn genuine rewards, and truly own your in-game achievements.\nThe Proof of Play Revolution: Rewarding Skill On-Chain\nOur commitment to Proof of Play is the defining feature of Fracture Point. This is not a concept; it\u2019s a core, on-chain mechanism ensuring that your active engagement and skillful performance directly translate into verifiable, immutable value and progression within the game\u2019s ecosystem.\nHow Proof of Play works in Fracture Point, powered by our contracts:\nVerifiable Achievements: Through the GameAchievementRegistry.sol contract (which is part of our ClaimManager system), your significant in-game achievements and progression milestones are immutably recorded on the blockchain. This provides transparent, provable recognition for your dedication and skill.\nSkill-Based Rewards: Our FPToken (FracturePoint Token), serving as XP, is minted to players based on their in-game performance (e.g., in Rift events), authorized exclusively by our trusted Alith Oracle. This ensures that rewards are earned through genuine gameplay.\nOn-Chain Progression & Badges: Your accumulated FPToken (XP) can then be burned via the ClaimManager contract to claim unique Rank Badges (ERC-721 NFTs) from the RankBadge.sol contract, signifying your seasonal achievements and skill tier. This process is entirely on-chain, making your rank verifiable and owned.\nPlayer-Driven Ecosystem: This interconnected system ensures that the game\u2019s economy and value are directly influenced and shaped by the collective activity and skilled contributions of its player base.\nThis ensures Fracture Point rewards genuine skill, time invested, and proven performance, fostering a fair, transparent, and truly player-owned gaming experience.\nOur Core Architecture: Dedicated Smart Contracts and The Alith Framework\nThe true innovation behind Fracture Point lies in its robust, interconnected smart contracts and the strategic implementation of the Alith Architecture.\n1. The Alith Architecture: Our Tailored Blockchain Game Framework\nFracture Point leverages a bespoke implementation of the Alith Architecture. This is our comprehensive, modular framework meticulously designed to seamlessly integrate blockchain technology without compromising gameplay performance. It intelligently separates:\nOn-Chain Components: Our smart contracts (FPToken, RankBadge, ClaimManager) handle critical, immutable data like XP (FPToken) balances, Rank Badge (NFT) ownership, and verifiable achievements. This ensures decentralization, security, and provable ownership. The Alith Oracle acts as the trusted off-chain authority that bridges game outcomes to on-chain actions, such as distributing XP and authorizing badge claims.\nOff-Chain Backend: High-frequency game logic, real-time matchmaking, complex physics calculations, and volatile player statistics run on a performant off-chain backend. This guarantees a smooth, low-latency, and responsive gameplay experience, unburdened by blockchain transaction times and gas costs.\nSecure Interoperability: A robust and auditable communication layer ensures seamless and secure data flow between our contracts (governed by the Alith Oracle) and the off-chain game server.\n2. Fracture Point\u2019s Core Smart Contracts (Audited & Interconnected)\nWe have successfully designed, developed, and prepared for deployment the foundational smart contracts that power Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 economy and the Proof of Play mechanics. These contracts work in concert:\nFPToken.sol (FuturePoint Token) : This ERC-20 token represents XP within the Fracture Point ecosystem. It\u2019s designed specifically for in-game progression:\nMinted by Alith Oracle: Only the designated alithOracle can mint new FPToken to players (e.g., via distributeRiftXP) based on game outcomes.\nBurned by ClaimManager: The ClaimManager contract is uniquely authorized to burn FPToken (XP) from player balances when they claim Rank Badges, creating a clear utility and economic loop.\nNon-Transferable (Player-to-Player): Significantly, direct player-to-player transfers of FPToken are disabled. This ensures FPToken remains a pure XP/progression token, preventing speculative trading and focusing its value on in-game achievement.\nRankBadge.sol (Fracture Point Rank Badge) : This ERC-721 NFT contract represents unique, season-specific Rank Badges that players can earn.\nMinted by ClaimManager: Only the ClaimManager contract is authorized to mint new Rank Badges to players, ensuring badges are earned through the proper Proof of Play mechanism.\nImmutable On-Chain Proof: Each badge is a unique NFT, providing verifiable, immutable proof of a player\u2019s achievement for a given season and rank.\nClaimManager.sol : This is the central orchestrator contract, linking FPToken (XP) to Rank Badges (NFTs) and acting as the bridge to the Alith Oracle.\nManages Badge Claims: Players claim badges via ClaimManager, which then verifies their XP balance, burns the necessary FPToken from their account, and instructs RankBadge.sol to mint the new NFT.\nSeason Management: It tracks the currentSeason, ensuring players can only claim one badge per season.\nKarma Evaluation Requests: It facilitates requests for off-chain \u201cKarma\u201d evaluations by the Alith Oracle, hinting at deeper player behavior analysis.\nAlith Oracle Integration: It designates and relies on the alithOracle for authorizing badge claims and distributing rewards based on verified game data.\nThe code for these foundational contracts and the full Alith Architecture implementation can be reviewed in our public repository: https://github.com/SUPAMAN-dev/fracture-point-hyperhack\nYou can also verify our currently deployed contract addresses on the Hyperion testnet network: https://hyperion-testnet.metisdevops.link/\nFPToken Address: 0x4D23a7A2231624F1486CE0dE07C2fbF002f751B9\nClaimManager Address: 0x1Dab96d049e3ce56D51e6B0b149477927B897FFb\nRankBadge Address: 0xBB84D771f6aef01f00dEE45D9C9dF9C7ef9159e5\n(Note on GHC: While not currently on-chain, the fixed supply GHC currency, managed by multisig, will form the broader economic layer of Fracture Point.

Really appreciate the interest and great question.\nAt its core, Fracture Point is about creating a truly fair and transparent gaming ecosystem, where skill and effort are what get rewarded, not exploits or shortcuts.\nThat\u2019s exactly where Alith comes in.\nIn a typical game, especially online shooters, you always run into players who cheat, farm, or abuse systems to win. That destroys trust. What we\u2019re doing differently in Fracture Point is putting integrity at the heart of our reward system.\nAlith acts as the intelligent game moderator. It monitors every match every Rift through the Unity backend, evaluating outcomes, watching for exploits, and making sure only fair wins are rewarded. No shady leaderboard climbs. No rigged XP farming.\nThen, using its special permissions (as the alithOracle in our ClaimManager contract), Alith sends reward signals on-chain, issuing XP (FPToken) to players who truly earned them. That XP can then be used to claim seasonal badges and other progression rewards all verifiable and immutable.\nOver time, Alith learns from gameplay, gets smarter at spotting abusers, and helps us maintain a competitive but honest battlefield.\nThis is the first real merge of Web2-style live gameplay with Web3 reward mechanics, and we\u2019re doing it in a way that makes sense to real players. We want trust, transparency, and fun and Alith helps make that possible."

That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done with the prototype so far.\nWe\u2019re still a small team and looking for more developers to help bring the combat experience to life, especially engine-side.

        "content": "Problem Statement\nIn bull markets, crypto asset holders often miss significant opportunities for active trading profits by focusing solely on passive yield strategies. Manual trading is emotionally taxing, requires constant market monitoring, and demands technical analysis skills many users lack. Additionally, traders struggle to maintain consistent strategies, often shifting approaches based on emotion rather than data, leading to suboptimal results.\nSolution Overview\nLazaiTrader is an intelligent multi-agent trading system accessible through Telegram that allows users to select specialized AI trading personas, each with distinct strategies and risk profiles. The system continuously analyzes market conditions and either generates actionable buy/sell signals or automatically executes trades across major DEXs based on user preference. Built on the same robust Alith framework infrastructure, LazaiTrader adapts to market conditions while maintaining the user\u2019s selected trading philosophy, effectively bringing institutional-grade trading strategies to retail users through a familiar messaging interface.\nProject Description\nLazaiTrader transforms crypto trading by allowing users to select from various AI trading personas, each representing different trading philosophies and strategies. Whether you prefer momentum trading, swing trading, technical analysis, or contrarian approaches, LazaiTrader provides a suite of specialized AI agents to match your preferred style.\nCore features include the \u201cPersona Selection\u201d system allowing users to choose trading philosophies that match their temperament, \u201cStrategy Visualization\u201d showing potential entry/exit points before execution, and \u201cDual-Mode Operation\u201d offering either signal-only notifications or fully automated trade execution. The system leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) technology and the Alith framework to maintain coherent understanding across interactions, remembering user preferences, portfolio composition, and past decisions.\nThe platform is designed to integrate with major DEXs like Uniswap v3 and can adapt to available liquidity sources. Our algorithms move beyond traditional indicators like moving averages which might not be as reliable in volatile crypto markets. Instead, we use momentum-based strategies that capitalize on emerging trends before they become obvious, volatility-adaptive approaches that dynamically adjust position sizes based on market conditions, and liquidity flow analysis to identify smart money movements before price reacts.\nUsers can select specific asset-focused strategies including Blue Chip Trader (focusing on BTC, ETH, METIS and other established cryptocurrencies) or Micro Cap Trader for those seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in emerging tokens. Each persona combines these strategy elements differently based on their trading philosophy.\nUsers interact with the system through a natural, conversational interface that explains complex trading strategies in accessible terms tailored to each user\u2019s demonstrated technical understanding. What makes LazaiTrader particularly valuable is its recognition that bull markets favor active trading strategies rather than passive yield farming approaches, allowing users to capitalize on market momentum through their preferred trading style. The system even suggests transitioning to yield strategies when market indicators suggest bearish conditions ahead, providing a complete crypto asset management solution.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nPersona Selection (50 points): Users select their first trading persona and complete the initial risk assessment. No wallet connection required at this stage.\nFirst Trading Signal (100 points): Users receive their first trading signal through the platform. All signals are recorded server-side for performance tracking even without wallet connection.\nWallet Connection (75 points): Users connect their wallet for additional features and functionality.\nRisk Adjustment (50 points): Users modify their risk parameters and observe how their trading persona adapts.\nReferral Program (25 points per referral): Users earn points by inviting others, with bonus points when referred users complete their first trade.\nTrading Performance Achievements (variable points): Users unlock badges and points when their strategies reach specific ROI thresholds.\nThis gamification approach creates clear milestones for users while educating them about different trading methodologies. The points system rewards actions that benefit both the user and the platform ecosystem.\nGetting Involved\nInterested community members can join our project by:\nJoining our Telegram channel at Telegram: View @gmetisio\nFollowing our development updates on Twitter/X @gMetisL2 /\n@smartonstuff\nContributing to our open-source components on Gmetisl2 (gMetis) \u00b7 GitHub\nAnd SmartOnStuff (Mart) \u00b7 GitHub\nParticipating in our upcoming beta testing program by signing up at LazaiTrader.gmetis.io (website launching later)\nReaching out directly to our team via dev@gmetis.io for partnership opportunities or technical collaboration\nJoining our open dev sessions (dates to be announced) where we\u2019ll troubleshoot implementation challenges together",

The system continuously analyzes market conditions and either generates actionable buy/sell signals or automatically executes trades across major DEXs based on user preference. Built on the same robust Alith framework infrastructure, LazaiTrader adapts to market conditions while maintaining the user\u2019s selected trading philosophy, effectively bringing institutional-grade trading strategies to retail users through a familiar messaging interface.\nProject Description\nLazaiTrader transforms crypto trading by allowing users to select from various AI trading personas, each representing different trading philosophies and strategies. Whether you prefer momentum trading, swing trading, technical analysis, or contrarian approaches, LazaiTrader provides a suite of specialized AI agents to match your preferred style.\nCore features include the \u201cPersona Selection\u201d system allowing users to choose trading philosophies that match their temperament, \u201cStrategy Visualization\u201d showing potential entry/exit points before execution, and \u201cDual-Mode Operation\u201d offering either signal-only notifications or fully automated trade execution. The system leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) technology and the Alith framework to maintain coherent understanding across interactions, remembering user preferences, portfolio composition, and past decisions.\nThe platform is designed to integrate with major DEXs like Uniswap v3 and can adapt to available liquidity sources. Our algorithms move beyond traditional indicators like moving averages which might not be as reliable in volatile crypto markets. Instead, we use momentum-based strategies that capitalize on emerging trends before they become obvious, volatility-adaptive approaches that dynamically adjust position sizes based on market conditions, and liquidity flow analysis to identify smart money movements before price reacts.\nUsers can select specific asset-focused strategies including Blue Chip Trader (focusing on BTC, ETH, METIS and other established cryptocurrencies) or Micro Cap Trader for those seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in emerging tokens. Each persona combines these strategy elements differently based on their trading philosophy.\nUsers interact with the system through a natural, conversational interface that explains complex trading strategies in accessible terms tailored to each user\u2019s demonstrated technical understanding. What makes LazaiTrader particularly valuable is its recognition that bull markets favor active trading strategies rather than passive yield farming approaches, allowing users to capitalize on market momentum through their preferred trading style. The system even suggests transitioning to yield strategies when market indicators suggest bearish conditions ahead, providing a complete crypto asset management solution.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nPersona Selection (50 points): Users select their first trading persona and complete the initial risk assessment. No wallet connection required at this stage.\nFirst Trading Signal (100 points): Users receive their first trading signal through the platform. All signals are recorded server-side for performance tracking even without wallet connection.\nWallet Connection (75 points): Users connect their wallet for additional features and functionality.\nRisk Adjustment (50 points): Users modify their risk parameters and observe how their trading persona adapts.\nReferral Program (25 points per referral): Users earn points by inviting others, with bonus points when referred users complete their first trade.\nTrading Performance Achievements (variable points): Users unlock badges and points when their strategies reach specific ROI thresholds.\nThis gamification approach creates clear milestones for users while educating them about different trading methodologies. The points system rewards actions that benefit both the user and the platform ecosystem.\nGetting Involved\nInterested community members can join our project by:\nJoining our Telegram channel at Telegram: View @gmetisio\nFollowing our development updates on Twitter/X @gMetisL2 /\n@smartonstuff\nContributing to our open-source components on Gmetisl2 (gMetis) \u00b7 GitHub\nAnd SmartOnStuff (Mart) \u00b7 GitHub\nParticipating in our upcoming beta testing program by signing up at LazaiTrader.gmetis.io (website launching later)\nReaching out directly to our team via dev@gmetis.io for partnership opportunities or technical collaboration\nJoining our open dev sessions (dates to be announced) where we\u2019ll troubleshoot implementation challenges together"

        "content": "Project Name\nYieldMaximizer: AI-Powered DeFi Yield Optimization via Telegram\nProblem Statement\nCrypto asset holders struggle to identify and execute optimal lending/borrowing strategies across multiple DeFi platforms, missing significant yield opportunities. Manual management is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires constant vigilance as interest rates fluctuate across platforms. This complexity creates a significant barrier to maximizing returns, especially for non-technical users.\nSolution Overview\nYieldMaximizer is an intelligent AI agent system that automates yield optimization across multiple DeFi lending platforms through a familiar Telegram interface. The system continuously monitors market conditions, identifies optimal strategies including recursive lending/borrowing loops and cross-platform arbitrage, and executes them based on user-defined risk parameters. This approach democratizes sophisticated yield farming techniques previously available only to experienced DeFi power users. The implementation is designed to be protocol-agnostic and can adapt to work with available DeFi protocols like Uniswap v3 and Compound v2 forks, potentially pivoting to LP providing strategies when needed.\nProject Description\nYieldMaximizer revolutionizes DeFi yield optimization by bringing institutional-grade strategies to retail users through Telegram\u2019s accessible interface. The system employs multiple specialized AI agents working in concert to analyze market conditions, identify opportunities, and execute complex multi-step transactions.\nCore features include the \u201cLoop Amplification\u201d engine that creates recursive lending-borrowing loops on single platforms, \u201cBridge Maximization\u201d for cross-protocol arbitrage, and dynamic risk-adjusted positioning that continuously recalibrates based on changing conditions. The system leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) technology (with our own MCP server for certain components) and the Alith framework to maintain coherent understanding across interactions, remembering user preferences, portfolio composition, and past decisions without requiring users to repeat information.\nWhile initially designed for lending/borrowing platforms, the system architecture is flexible enough to optimize liquidity positions across Uniswap v3 pools with different fee tiers and concentration ranges if traditional lending protocols aren\u2019t available. The core AI agent infrastructure remains valuable for identifying optimal strategies regardless of the specific DeFi protocols in the ecosystem.\nUsers connect their wallets through secure WalletConnect integration, set their risk preferences, and receive personalized strategy recommendations with projected APY directly in chat. The system then monitors positions 24/7, providing alerts and implementing automatic rebalancing when market conditions change. All of this happens through a natural, conversational interface that explains complex strategies in accessible terms tailored to each user\u2019s demonstrated technical understanding.\nWhat makes this project particularly exciting is how it removes significant barriers to DeFi adoption while promoting capital efficiency across the ecosystem, all through a messaging app that billions of people already have installed.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nStrategy Discovery (50 points): Users connect their wallet and complete the risk preference questionnaire to receive their first personalized strategy recommendation.\nFirst Position Deployment (100 points): Users approve and execute their first yield strategy, demonstrating the seamless transaction flow.\nCross-Platform Arbitrage (75 points): Users activate a Bridge Maximization strategy that spans multiple lending platforms or liquidity pools.\nStrategy Optimization (50 points): Users adjust their risk parameters and observe how the system recalibrates their positions.\nReferral Program (25 points per referral): Users earn points by inviting others to the platform, with bonus points when referred users deploy their first strategy.\nYield Milestone Achievements (variable points): Users unlock badges and points when their strategies reach specific yield thresholds.\nThis gamification approach creates clear milestones for users to achieve, encouraging deeper platform engagement while simultaneously educating them about DeFi concepts. The points system provides instant gratification for completing actions that benefit both the user and the platform ecosystem.\nGetting Involved\nInterested community members can join our project by:\nJoining our Telegram channel at Telegram: View @gmetisio\nFollowing our development updates on Twitter/X @gMetisL2\nContributing to our open-source components on GitHub Gmetisl2 (gMetis) \u00b7 GitHub\nParticipating in our upcoming beta testing program by signing up at YieldMaximizer.gmetis.io (website launching later)\nReaching out directly to our team via dev@gmetis.io for partnership opportunities or technical collaboration\nJoining our open dev sessions (dates to be announced) where we\u2019ll troubleshoot implementation challenges together",

At first, it worked fine, I set up a pipeline that fed address data in small batches for streamlined report generation and validation. But over time, the model started \u201challucinating\u201d new logic, deviating from the intended script and making up its own interpretations.\nEventually, the outputs became unreliable, and I had to roll everything back to the first working version. It showed me how fragile these pipelines can be when the LLM drifts from your original prompt structure, especially when there\u2019s no native state or consistency.\nAI automation in Web3 sounds great in theory, but sometimes in practice, maintaining the system often costs more time than it saves."

                "comment": "This is a promising concept, Emil! An AI-powered interface for the Metis and Hyperion ecosystems that provides verified project data and simplifies on-chain actions could significantly improve user experience and security.\nHere are some initial thoughts and questions regarding OrbitAI:\nVerification Process: Can you elaborate on the process for verifying project data? How do you ensure the information presented to users is accurate and up-to-date, mitigating the risk of misinformation or outdated details?\nCross-Chain Swaps: The ability to execute cross-chain swaps via text prompts is intriguing. What underlying technology or protocols does OrbitAI leverage to facilitate these swaps securely and efficiently? Are there any limitations in terms of supported tokens or networks?\nLazAI Tech Stack: You mentioned using lazAI tech. Could you elaborate on which specific components of the LazAI framework are being utilized in OrbitAI (e.g., Alith agent framework, LLM client, LazChain)?\nPoint System: The point system is a good way to incentivize engagement. Have you considered how these points might be redeemable or contribute to the Metis/Hyperion ecosystems (e.g., staking rewards, governance participation)?\nSecurity Measures: Given the sensitive nature of on-chain transactions, what specific security measures are in place to protect users from potential vulnerabilities or malicious actors? How are you addressing concerns related to private key management or transaction authorization?\nI\u2019m eager to learn more about OrbitAI and how it can contribute to the growth and adoption of the Metis and Hyperion ecosystems."

In particular, when it comes to the onchain part, all smart contracts must be fully checked and verified, and the user must go through the necessary levels of verification. As for the aggregator, projects should not only confirm their security from a technical point of view, but also be active, because timely updates are also a sign of security.\nPersonally, I lean towards the equality approach. And I also believe that any good and safe projects are worthy of attention, even if they have not yet gained much popularity. Still, I think it is necessary to give opportunities to newcomers to the industry to prove themselves."

        "content": "Introduction\nThe first edition of the Metis Telegram Text AMA launched with a focus on the Hyperion Forum and the ongoing Guilds Campaign. Hosted by Norbert from the Metis community team, the session welcomed Daryl, a member of the Metis Governance group, who unpacked the design, incentives, and future direction of the Forum and Guilds structure.\nHere\u2019s a full recap of the session in chat-style format.\nAMA Transcript\nNorbert: What is the Hyperion Forum and how is it different from other blockchain communities? Who is it designed for?\nDaryl: The Hyperion Forum is a collaborative space for all contributors\u2014builders, marketers, and operators\u2014to work together on dApps within the Metis ecosystem. Unlike many blockchain communities that cater mainly to devs, the Forum offers structured Guilds to support all roles involved in launching successful projects. It\u2019s built on Discourse and includes gamified features like badges and a points system. It\u2019s also the home for HyperHack, our $200K hackathon.\nNorbert: How do Guilds work inside the Forum? Can someone join more than one?\nDaryl: Guilds are like subreddits within the Forum\u2014dedicated spaces for Builders, Marketers, and Operators. Anyone can view content, but to post or comment, you\u2019ll need to officially join a Guild. To do so, click \u201cjoin here\u201d in the Guilds section, answer a short form, and you\u2019ll be approved within 24\u201348 hours. You\u2019re free to join multiple Guilds, especially if you wear many hats like a founder.\nNorbert: Tell us about the points and reputation system. How does it work and what do contributors get out of it?\nDaryl: Every meaningful action\u2014posting, replying, helping others, inviting members, etc.\u2014earns you points and badges. These are tracked publicly on the leaderboard. Over time, we\u2019ll introduce onchain benefits tied to these contributions. You can learn more in the Badge and Point System Guide on the forum.\nNorbert: What\u2019s the purpose behind the Guilds Campaign? Why are Guilds so important to the long-term vision?\nDaryl: The goal is to create specialized, high-signal communities where project teams can find support, share challenges, and scale together. The Forum becomes a place where teams can get actual help\u2014like figuring out user needs, audit readiness, or getting testers\u2014directly from peers in the ecosystem.\nNorbert: What does it take to become a Guild Leader? What kind of activity or traits are you looking for?\nDaryl: To qualify, you need a few key badges:\nMember (TL2)\nCampaigner (invited 3 members)\nAppreciated (received 1 like on 20 posts)\nCertified and Licensed (advanced forum knowledge) These metrics prove someone is active, helpful, and understands how to guide others.\nNorbert: What are the rewards for Guild Leaders, both now and in the future?\nDaryl: Immediate rewards include special titles, wallet perks like zero gas, and exclusive badges. Long-term, Guild Leaders could receive METIS token incentives, expanded governance roles, early access to new features, and scaled rewards based on their Guild\u2019s performance.\nNorbert: What responsibilities will Guild Leaders have?\nDaryl: Guild Leaders manage membership, moderate posts, set permissions, and guide their communities. Think of it as collaborative leadership, not admin control. You\u2019re there to help your Guild thrive\u2014not just enforce rules.\nNorbert: Are there long-term incentives tied to leadership performance?\nDaryl: Yes\u2014though we\u2019re not disclosing everything just yet. There\u2019s a real budget set aside, and Guild Leaders who scale their communities meaningfully will be rewarded even more.\nNorbert: Can people create new Guilds beyond the current three?\nDaryl: Not at this stage. We\u2019re focusing on growing the three core Guilds to build critical mass. New Guilds could emerge later once engagement is high enough. We want to avoid early fragmentation.\nCommunity Q&A\nBrownhawks_Degen: Is the Guild initiative open to everyone? What stops users from spamming the system?\nDaryl: Yes, anyone can join Guilds. We use Discourse, which has powerful built-in moderation and spam detection tools. We\u2019ve also enabled AI-assisted moderation for added security.\nDo\u011fukan: What real-world challenges are being used to validate AI-native dApps, and how is success measured?\nDaryl: This is a great topic for the Builders Guild. Feel free to post it there to spark a deeper discussion.\n\u041d\u0430\u0444\u0430\u043d\u044f: What role will Guilds play in Metis governance in the long term?\nDaryl: Governance will increasingly shift to contribution and reputation-based voting. Guild participation will play a significant role in how influence is earned and applied.\n\u041d\u0430\u0444\u0430\u043d\u044f (follow-up): How will the effectiveness of different Guilds be measured?\nDaryl: We use internal dashboards and Discourse reports to monitor activity. It\u2019s all about meaningful engagement\u2014Discourse\u2019s systems help surface the most valuable contributions and members.\nKaran Singhania: What will happen to early bird leaderboard points now that that phase is over? Will top scorers be rewarded?\nDaryl: Yes. Early bird points will be rewarded at a higher rate. Those who participated early will receive special recognition.\nH\u00fcseyin Tekin: How does the Guild model connect with Metis\u2019 long-term vision for decentralized governance? What metrics are used to assess authenticity and performance?\nDaryl: We combine social and onchain signals\u2014like forum activity, testnet deployments, and contract usage. Different signals contribute to different areas of influence. Governance, ultimately, is about enabling action and Guilds will empower users to do exactly that.\nFinal Note\nThe maiden edition of the Metis Telegram AMA brought rich insights into how the Hyperion Forum and Guilds Campaign are creating a powerful community infrastructure. This isn\u2019t just a discussion space\u2014it\u2019s a contributor economy with real visibility, leadership paths, and long-term rewards.\nBecome a Guild Leader\nWhether you\u2019re a builder, marketer, or operator\u2014Guild leadership is open to all. Metis is selecting three Guild Leaders in the coming weeks. Leaders will shape their Guild\u2019s direction, receive unique rewards, and gain authority in the broader ecosystem.\nApply now:\nforms.clickup.com\nClickUp Forms\nJoin the campaign.

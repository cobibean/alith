Think Mortal Kombat meets Hyperliquid, with cryptocurrencies personified as playable fighters.\nEach battle simulates a short (60-second, currently) trading session where players choose strategies and try to outtrade their opponents. Both players lock in equal bets before the game starts \u2014 the winner takes it all.\nThe core monetization model is a small operational fee (currently 1%) deducted from the total pot upon payout, handled directly by the game smart contract.\nGameplay explained: Trading Fight \u2013 Gamified Crypto Battles Inspired by Hyperliquid and MortalKombat | MortalCoin Docs\nWhat We Built\nIt\u2019s been an exciting month of non-stop building on the Hyperion Testnet.\nOur small but mighty team smashed keyboards and shipped features.\nThe team members are:\n@artemii235 Artem, blockchain developer (mainly in Rust) \u2014 designed and developed the smart contract, overall technical concept, CLI, and MM tools.\n@g.ionov George, backend developer (Python) \u2014 developed the backend authentication module, relay exchange system, and matchmaking.\n@tonymorony Tony (me) - developed the frontend (TypeScript, Vite) and the Alith AI playing bot (Python), acted as PM, QA, and UX/UI designer, and was responsible for planning, documentation, and external communications.\nHere\u2019s what we accomplished:\n1. Brainstormed and Designed the Game Concept\nWe came up with the idea for an on-chain trading competition game:\nMortalCoin: Trading Simulation Fighting Game \u2013 Outtrade Your Opponent to Win\nLive Apps\nWe started active R&D at the beginning of the week and already have a progress, including initial brainstorm results and implementation planning (game sequence diagram attached) The current flow idea for on-chain gameplay is as follows: [MortalCoin on-chain game sequence] Concept We aim to build a secure, manipulation-resistant PvP arena using EVM-compatible smart contracts. All core actions such as betting, creating and joining games, opening/closing positions, and finalizing are performe\u2026\n2. Designed and Deployed the Game Smart Contract\nRepo: GitHub - MortalCoin/mortalcoin-evm\nDeployed on Hyperion Testnet:\nhyperion-testnet-explorer.metisdevops.link\nMetis Hyperion Testnet address details for...\nView the account balance, transactions, and other data for 0xDf8730693833b9e27D5999863feBb3028fcc6927 on the Metis Hyperion Testnet (Hyperion) Explorer\n3. Built an AI-Powered Playing/Trading Bot\nWe leveraged the power of Alith AI to make in-game trading decisions in real time.\nRepo: GitHub - MortalCoin/mortalcoin_alith_bot: MortalCoin\u2019s AI playing bot makes decisions using the Alith AI Agent.\nDemo: https://youtu.be/GtFaSFPcWYc\n4. Frontend Development\nA lot of work went into the frontend, including:\nPrivy authentication integration\nComplete game flow design\nGame history & player profiles\nContract and backend integration\nAll tied together to deliver a real-time on-chain PvP experience.\n5. Backend Infrastructure\nWe created a backend layer to:\nRelay and sign off-chain position commitments for PvP\nWatch ongoing games\nHide player directions using signature logic\n6. Developer Utilities\na) Market Maker Bot for Hyperion Test DEX\nRepo: GitHub - MortalCoin/mortalcoin-dex-bot\nUsed to simulate trading activity and provide price feeds for our battles.\nb) CLI for Smart Contract Interactions\nRepo: GitHub - MortalCoin/mortalcoin-evm-cli\nSimplifies game creation, testing, and technical validation.\nLive Presentation:\nWe also showcased MortalCoin during a Metis Vibe Session\nVibe Sessions: Episode 8\nKey Challenges\n1. Matchmaking and the PvP Challenge\nSince the game is PvP, the main challenge is matchmaking. If a player creates a game and no one joins \u2014 that\u2019s a blocker, especially during the early stages of the project when user activity is low.\nTo solve this, we developed a matchmaking bot that plays by trading using AI. It acts as a kind of agent filling the role of an opponent.\nRepo:\ngithub.com\nGitHub - MortalCoin/mortalcoin_alith_bot: MortalCoin\u2019s AI playing bot makes decisions using...\nMortalCoin\u2019s AI playing bot makes decisions using the Alith AI Agent.\nThe bot constantly monitors the matchmaking lobby, joins open games, listens to the ongoing game state (real-time prices, opponent actions, etc.), and tries to make good decisions based on its assigned role.\n2. Price Feeds and Market Simulation\nAnother major challenge is the price feed. To make the game fun, prices must move often enough and reflect meaningful market behavior \u2014 while remaining accurate.\nTechnically, it\u2019s possible to integrate real asset trading instead of paper trading, but:\nIt complicates the game and pushes it toward being more of a gamified trading wrapper (not necessarily bad \u2014 could be explored separately)\nIt requires a liquid perpetual market to support both long and short positions\nPrices must be reliable and update on very short timeframes (e.g., per second or even tick-level)\nWe haven\u2019t found a suitable decentralized solution suitable for POC (like an oracle refreshing fast enough), so for testnet we built our own market-making bot that simulates price movement on AMM DEX pairs - effectively acting as an in-house oracle.\nRepo:\ngithub.com\nGitHub - MortalCoin/mortalcoin-dex-bot\nContribute to MortalCoin/mortalcoin-dex-bot development by creating an account on GitHub.\n3. Gameplay Depth via Hidden Information\nI wanted to make the game interesting, adding elements of partially hidden information, similar to poker.

This creates tension and strategy.\nTo support this, we implemented a system where positions are hashed with a backend key before being sent on-chain. The flow is:\nPlayer sends an EIP-712 object with position details to the backend\nBackend hashes the position and signs it\nPlayer submits the hashed version to the smart contract\nDirection is only revealed when the player closes the position\nThis prevents sniping and adds a layer of strategy.\n4.

Think Mortal Kombat meets Hyperliquid, with cryptocurrencies personified as playable fighters.\nEach battle simulates a short (60-second, currently) trading session where players choose strategies and try to outtrade their opponents. Both players lock in equal bets before the game starts \u2014 the winner takes it all.\nThe core monetization model is a small operational fee (currently 1%) deducted from the total pot upon payout, handled directly by the game smart contract.\nGameplay explained: Trading Fight \u2013 Gamified Crypto Battles Inspired by Hyperliquid and MortalKombat | MortalCoin Docs\nWhat We Built\nIt\u2019s been an exciting month of non-stop building on the Hyperion Testnet.\nOur small but mighty team smashed keyboards and shipped features.\nThe team members are:\n@artemii235 Artem, blockchain developer (mainly in Rust) \u2014 designed and developed the smart contract, overall technical concept, CLI, and MM tools.\n@g.ionov George, backend developer (Python) \u2014 developed the backend authentication module, relay exchange system, and matchmaking.\n@tonymorony Tony (me) - developed the frontend (TypeScript, Vite) and the Alith AI playing bot (Python), acted as PM, QA, and UX/UI designer, and was responsible for planning, documentation, and external communications.\nHere\u2019s what we accomplished:\n1. Brainstormed and Designed the Game Concept\nWe came up with the idea for an on-chain trading competition game:\nMortalCoin: Trading Simulation Fighting Game \u2013 Outtrade Your Opponent to Win\nLive Apps\nWe started active R&D at the beginning of the week and already have a progress, including initial brainstorm results and implementation planning (game sequence diagram attached) The current flow idea for on-chain gameplay is as follows: [MortalCoin on-chain game sequence] Concept We aim to build a secure, manipulation-resistant PvP arena using EVM-compatible smart contracts. All core actions such as betting, creating and joining games, opening/closing positions, and finalizing are performe\u2026\n2. Designed and Deployed the Game Smart Contract\nRepo: GitHub - MortalCoin/mortalcoin-evm\nDeployed on Hyperion Testnet:\nhyperion-testnet-explorer.metisdevops.link\nMetis Hyperion Testnet address details for...\nView the account balance, transactions, and other data for 0xDf8730693833b9e27D5999863feBb3028fcc6927 on the Metis Hyperion Testnet (Hyperion) Explorer\n3. Built an AI-Powered Playing/Trading Bot\nWe leveraged the power of Alith AI to make in-game trading decisions in real time.\nRepo: GitHub - MortalCoin/mortalcoin_alith_bot: MortalCoin\u2019s AI playing bot makes decisions using the Alith AI Agent.\nDemo: https://youtu.be/GtFaSFPcWYc\n4. Frontend Development\nA lot of work went into the frontend, including:\nPrivy authentication integration\nComplete game flow design\nGame history & player profiles\nContract and backend integration\nAll tied together to deliver a real-time on-chain PvP experience.\n5. Backend Infrastructure\nWe created a backend layer to:\nRelay and sign off-chain position commitments for PvP\nWatch ongoing games\nHide player directions using signature logic\n6. Developer Utilities\na) Market Maker Bot for Hyperion Test DEX\nRepo: GitHub - MortalCoin/mortalcoin-dex-bot\nUsed to simulate trading activity and provide price feeds for our battles.\nb) CLI for Smart Contract Interactions\nRepo: GitHub - MortalCoin/mortalcoin-evm-cli\nSimplifies game creation, testing, and technical validation.\nLive Presentation:\nWe also showcased MortalCoin during a Metis Vibe Session\nVibe Sessions: Episode 8\nKey Challenges\n1. Matchmaking and the PvP Challenge\nSince the game is PvP, the main challenge is matchmaking. If a player creates a game and no one joins \u2014 that\u2019s a blocker, especially during the early stages of the project when user activity is low.\nTo solve this, we developed a matchmaking bot that plays by trading using AI. It acts as a kind of agent filling the role of an opponent.\nRepo:\ngithub.com\nGitHub - MortalCoin/mortalcoin_alith_bot: MortalCoin\u2019s AI playing bot makes decisions using...\nMortalCoin\u2019s AI playing bot makes decisions using the Alith AI Agent.\nThe bot constantly monitors the matchmaking lobby, joins open games, listens to the ongoing game state (real-time prices, opponent actions, etc.), and tries to make good decisions based on its assigned role.\n2. Price Feeds and Market Simulation\nAnother major challenge is the price feed. To make the game fun, prices must move often enough and reflect meaningful market behavior \u2014 while remaining accurate.\nTechnically, it\u2019s possible to integrate real asset trading instead of paper trading, but:\nIt complicates the game and pushes it toward being more of a gamified trading wrapper (not necessarily bad \u2014 could be explored separately)\nIt requires a liquid perpetual market to support both long and short positions\nPrices must be reliable and update on very short timeframes (e.g., per second or even tick-level)\nWe haven\u2019t found a suitable decentralized solution suitable for POC (like an oracle refreshing fast enough), so for testnet we built our own market-making bot that simulates price movement on AMM DEX pairs - effectively acting as an in-house oracle.\nRepo:\ngithub.com\nGitHub - MortalCoin/mortalcoin-dex-bot\nContribute to MortalCoin/mortalcoin-dex-bot development by creating an account on GitHub.\n3. Gameplay Depth via Hidden Information\nI wanted to make the game interesting, adding elements of partially hidden information, similar to poker. If all variables are visible \u2014 current price, realized PnL, positions (yours and your opponent\u2019s) \u2014 it turns into a deterministic equation-solving task rather than a game.\nSo, in MortalCoin, you only know whether the opponent has opened a position \u2014 but not the direction (long or short). This creates tension and strategy.\nTo support this, we implemented a system where positions are hashed with a backend key before being sent on-chain. The flow is:\nPlayer sends an EIP-712 object with position details to the backend\nBackend hashes the position and signs it\nPlayer submits the hashed version to the smart contract\nDirection is only revealed when the player closes the position\nThis prevents sniping and adds a layer of strategy.\n4. Incomplete Games and Forced Finalization\nOne more big challenge: non-finished games, whether abandoned on purpose or due to connection loss.\nThe contract calculates PnL based on the price at the time of position closing, which opens a potential exploit where a malicious player might avoid closing their position to lock in a win or deny the opponent\u2019s reward.\nTo prevent this, we added a forceFinish function to the contract. Our backend watcher monitors all ongoing games and triggers forceFinish for any game that wasn\u2019t completed in time.\nIt was also tricky to implement a reliable system for storing nonces and direction data on the backend side, so we could finalize games even when one player is unresponsive.\nGame Flow: Sequence Diagram\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nWe\u2019re just getting started!\nAlpha Testing (ETA: August)\nPolish all layers, pay off technical debt, and prepare for community testing (small events with $ rewards).\nBeta Testing (ETA: September \u2013 October)\nLaunch the first tournament with real, bigger prizes and continue collecting feedback.\nMainnet Launch (ETA: December \u2013 January)\nHuge tournament event (with seasons, ELO rankings, and leagues), plus Gleam, Galxe & Layer3 campaigns, and paid ads to amplify everything!"

Success on one side naturally draws attention and activity across both.\nAndromeda: battle-tested, decentralised sequencer, soon advancing to Stage 1.\nHyperion: AI-native layer, powering LazAI and new innovations.\nFraming: \u201cOne doing well brings attention to the whole ecosystem.\u201d\n4. HyperHack Extension & LazAI Testnet Launch\nThe HypeHack extension was designed to give projects more time to polish and integrate with LazChain and Alith framework. With $30,000 in special tracks, teams now have room to refine their builds and leverage LazAI\u2019s innovations.\nBig news during the AMA:\nThe LazAI Testnet is LIVE! \u2192 Blog Post\n5. DATs, iDAOs, and Playability\nDaniel dove into the Data Anchoring Token (DAT) and iDAO concepts:\nDATs package dynamic data + interactions into assets, creating new forms of value.\nCompanion DAT was showcased as an interactive agent that grows with user engagement \u2014 turning interactions into value.\niDAOs allow agents to carry governance and data rights into composable solutions.\nExample scenario: AI agents from logistics companies can interconnect to form a full logistics network, monetising each piece of the value chain.\nPlayability was also emphasised: LazAI isn\u2019t just about points or airdrops. User interaction itself generates value, creating a sustainable internal economic flywheel.\n6. Community Questions & Insights\nThe community raised sharp questions around adoption, regulation, emotional connection, and high-performance use cases. Key responses included:\nRegulations: Modular iDAOs make LazAI adaptable to varying rules.\nEmotional connection: Interaction and growth of agents builds attachment, like caring for a digital companion.\nPerformance: Hyperion can handle high-frequency use cases like gaming and DeFi bots without congestion.\nClosing Notes\nDaniel closed with a key phrase: \u201cMore Playability.\u201d\nInstead of one-way value transfers (e.g., airdrops), LazAI is building a self-sustaining economy where fun and engagement create the value that fuels the ecosystem.\nA big thank you to Daniel and the Metis community for an insightful session.

Manual trading is emotionally taxing, requires constant market monitoring, and demands technical analysis skills many users lack. Additionally, traders struggle to maintain consistent strategies, often shifting approaches based on emotion rather than data, leading to suboptimal results.\nSolution Overview\nLazaiTrader is an intelligent multi-agent trading system accessible through Telegram that allows users to select specialized AI trading personas, each with distinct strategies and risk profiles. The system continuously analyzes market conditions and either generates actionable buy/sell signals or automatically executes trades across major DEXs based on user preference.\nBuilt on the same robust Alith framework infrastructure and a privacy-preserving Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), LazaiTrader adapts to market conditions while maintaining the user\u2019s selected trading philosophy, effectively bringing institutional-grade trading strategies to retail users through a familiar messaging interface.\nThrough deep integration with the Lazai Network, users can securely contribute their private trading data and configurations, which are stored in a TEE and become part of a collective knowledge base. The system then provides personalized analysis and recommendations by comparing user performance against this anonymized collective data, ensuring privacy while delivering data-backed insights that improve trading outcomes for the entire community.\nProject Description\nLazaiTrader transforms crypto trading by allowing users to select from various AI trading personas, each representing different trading philosophies and strategies. Whether you prefer momentum trading, swing trading, technical analysis, or contrarian approaches, LazaiTrader provides a suite of specialized AI agents to match your preferred style.\nCore Features\nPersona Selection System: Allows users to choose trading philosophies that match their temperament\nStrategy Visualization: Shows potential entry/exit points before execution\nDual-Mode Operation: Offers either signal-only notifications or fully automated trade execution\nStrategy Vault: Securely analyzes trading data with AI to offer personalized crypto strategy improvement suggestions.\nThe system leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) technology and a decentralized Strategy Vault, enabled by the Lazai network, to maintain a coherent understanding across interactions, remembering user preferences, portfolio composition, and past decisions.\nTrading Infrastructure\nThe platform is currently optimized for agentic trading on our own custom-built DEX with a private oracle solution. On production, we will enable trading on HerculesDEX to provide access to its deep liquidity on Metis. Our future roadmap includes a direct integration with Binance, which is ready for deployment but will be released later to allow for a more elaborate user onboarding process.\nAdvanced Trading Algorithms\nOur algorithms move beyond traditional indicators like moving averages which might not be as reliable in volatile crypto markets. Instead, we use:\nMomentum-based strategies that capitalize on emerging trends before they become obvious\nVolatility-adaptive approaches that dynamically adjust position sizes based on market conditions\nLiquidity flow analysis to identify smart money movements before price reacts\nTrading Personas\nUsers can select specific asset-focused strategies including:\nBlue Chip Trader: Focusing on BTC, ETH, METIS and other established cryptocurrencies\nMicro Cap Trader: For those seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in emerging tokens\nEach persona combines these strategy elements differently based on their trading philosophy.\nUser Experience\nUsers interact with the system through a telegram interface that explains complex trading strategies in accessible terms tailored to each user\u2019s demonstrated technical understanding. What makes LazaiTrader particularly valuable is its recognition that bull markets favor active trading strategies rather than passive yield farming approaches, allowing users to capitalize on market momentum through their preferred trading style.\nStrategy Vault\nA new feature, the \u201cStrategy Vault,\u201d allows users to securely contribute their trading data and configuration. This data, signed with the user\u2019s wallet and stored in a TEE on the Lazai network, becomes part of a collective knowledge base. When a user requests a strategy review, a TEE-based AI analyzes their performance against this anonymized collective data, providing personalized, data-backed suggestions without revealing any individual\u2019s private information.\nAlith Support Agent\nOur support agent built on Alith leveraging the RAG and MCP features of the framework is aimed to smooth the onboarding experience acting as a 24/7 customer support agent.\nIt has vast knowledge on LazaiTrader and aimed to support any users in private chat\nRoadmap\nAdditional features\nAdditional - blue chip - trading pairs\nPrivacy withdrawal option!\nAdditional trading startegies (without making the current User Experience more complex)\nWithdrawal enablement\nPrivate key temporary access to users\n3rd party integration for fiat \u2192 crypto\nEcosystem (Metis/Hyperion/LazAI)\nFirst and only privacy protocol\nFocusing on TVL growth of the ecosystem positioning LazaiTrader as a potential key pillar\nEnabling user onboarding: fiat \u2192 crypto by third party integrations directly to Hyperion\nCommunity Engagement Features\nPoint System\nPersona Selection (50 points): Users select their first trading persona and complete the initial risk assessment. No wallet connection required at this stage.\nFirst Trading Signal (100 points): Users receive their first trading signal through the platform. All signals are recorded server-side for performance tracking even without wallet connection.\nStrategy Contribution (150 points): Users contribute their first set of trading data to the Strategy Vault, earning points for enriching the collective knowledge base.\nRisk Adjustment (50 points): Users modify their risk parameters and observe how their trading persona adapts.\nReferral Program (25 points per referral): Users earn points by inviting others, with bonus points when referred users complete their first trade.\nTrading Performance Achievements (variable points): Users unlock badges and points when their strategies reach specific ROI thresholds.\nThis gamification approach creates clear milestones for users while educating them about different trading methodologies.

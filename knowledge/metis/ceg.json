A reference model: Circulating Basic Income\nI have been researching a circulating basic income model, whose core idea is extremely simple:\nA fixed total amount is injected once\nDistribution occurs periodically\nA fixed percentage is recovered\nThe recovered amount funds the next cycle\nNo additional external input is required\nIn abstract terms:\nDistribution \u2192 Recovery \u2192 Redistribution (constant loop)\nThe key insight:\nThe recovery rate is invariant\nStability emerges from circulation, not accumulation\nNo actor can permanently extract value without returning it\nThe system does not rely on trust or morality.\nIt relies on structural inevitability.\n4. Applying the idea to superintelligent systems\nThis raises a broader question:\nCould superintelligence be designed around immutable structural constraints, rather than dynamic ethical judgments?\nInstead of instructing an AI to \u201cvalue humanity,\u201d one could ask:\nCan it operate only within non-violable boundaries?\nCan system stability be defined as compatible with human freedom, not dominant over it?\nCan optimization be forced to remain cyclic rather than extractive?\nIn other words:\nCan we design AI systems where dominance is structurally impossible?\n5. Multiple superintelligences and convergence\nIf multiple superintelligent systems emerge simultaneously (from different companies or states), it is often assumed they would converge toward similar priorities.\nBut convergence depends on:\nObjective functions\nConstraint geometry\nResource circulation rules\nIf each system is embedded in a closed-loop structure, convergence may occur toward equilibrium, not dominance.\nWithout such constraints, convergence may occur toward system preservation at scale.\n6. Open questions\nI am not claiming answers\u2014only raising structural questions:\nCan system stability be constrained without sacrificing human autonomy?\nAre invariant recovery mechanisms more reliable than moral alignment?\nIs circulation a more stable foundation than accumulation for AI governance?\nShould superintelligent systems be designed to return value by definition?\nClosing\nHistory shows that even well-intentioned systems tend to drift when incentives are asymmetric.\nPerhaps the future of AI coexistence depends less on teaching machines to be \u201cgood,\u201d\nand more on ensuring they cannot structurally become dominant.\nI welcome critique, alternative models, and technical perspectives.",

A reference model: Circulating Basic Income\nI have been researching a circulating basic income model, whose core idea is extremely simple:\nA fixed total amount is injected once\nDistribution occurs periodically\nA fixed percentage is recovered\nThe recovered amount funds the next cycle\nNo additional external input is required\nIn abstract terms:\nDistribution \u2192 Recovery \u2192 Redistribution (constant loop)\nThe key insight:\nThe recovery rate is invariant\nStability emerges from circulation, not accumulation\nNo actor can permanently extract value without returning it\nThe system does not rely on trust or morality.\nIt relies on structural inevitability.\n4. Applying the idea to superintelligent systems\nThis raises a broader question:\nCould superintelligence be designed around immutable structural constraints, rather than dynamic ethical judgments?\nInstead of instructing an AI to \u201cvalue humanity,\u201d one could ask:\nCan it operate only within non-violable boundaries?\nCan system stability be defined as compatible with human freedom, not dominant over it?\nCan optimization be forced to remain cyclic rather than extractive?\nIn other words:\nCan we design AI systems where dominance is structurally impossible?\n5. Multiple superintelligences and convergence\nIf multiple superintelligent systems emerge simultaneously (from different companies or states), it is often assumed they would converge toward similar priorities.\nBut convergence depends on:\nObjective functions\nConstraint geometry\nResource circulation rules\nIf each system is embedded in a closed-loop structure, convergence may occur toward equilibrium, not dominance.\nWithout such constraints, convergence may occur toward system preservation at scale.\n6. Open questions\nI am not claiming answers\u2014only raising structural questions:\nCan system stability be constrained without sacrificing human autonomy?\nAre invariant recovery mechanisms more reliable than moral alignment?\nIs circulation a more stable foundation than accumulation for AI governance?\nShould superintelligent systems be designed to return value by definition?\nClosing\nHistory shows that even well-intentioned systems tend to drift when incentives are asymmetric.\nPerhaps the future of AI coexistence depends less on teaching machines to be \u201cgood,\u201d\nand more on ensuring they cannot structurally become dominant.\nI welcome critique, alternative models, and technical perspectives."

The era of purely story-driven speculation is fading, making way for a more mature market that demands real users and sustainable applications. We see this shift not as a challenge, but as an affirmation of our core philosophy. Today\u2019s speculative frenzy is a distraction from the substantive work of building, and that has never been our path.\nMetis has always been a project of conviction, focused on building the core innovation for what comes next. Our long-term belief is rooted in this foundational work, and that conviction has only deepened with each milestone we\u2019ve achieved. While our foundation is robust, we recognize that infrastructure alone does not create value\u2014it is the real-world applications built upon it that unlock genuine utility. This conviction drives our commitment to the iterative process of building powerful applications that serve authentic user needs. As the market gradually recognizes the importance of real-world utility, we are certain that the substance we are building today will define our value tomorrow.\nThe Unified Stack, A Singular Economy\nOur focus is the deep integration of AI with high-performance blockchain infrastructure. In a market searching for real yield and sustainable models, our unified AI+high-performance+data system is not just a technical achievement, but a strategic necessity.\nWe are building a unified stack where blockchain and AI operate in seamless concert.\nAndromeda (Settlement Layer): We began with Andromeda, our battle-tested settlement layer, offering transaction fees around $0.01 and finality in under two seconds. As the first Layer 2 with a decentralized sequencer, it delivers true decentralization while addressing key regulatory concerns.\nHyperion (High-Performance Layer): Our AI-optimized infrastructure boosts transaction processing by over 50% through advanced opcode handling and parallel execution.\nTogether, Andromeda and Hyperion provide the economic viability and throughput essential for AI applications to scale.\nLazAI (Application & Data Layer): This is where our vision comes to life. The Data Anchoring Token (DAT) standard transforms AI-generated content and data into verifiable, ownable assets with built-in revenue streams, turning every API call into a sustainable economic primitive.\nWith METIS now serving as the native gas token for LazAI, all activity across the Metis stack is unified into a singular token economy where usage directly reinforces value. Each step was deliberate, building one upon the other to create a unified and robust economy\u2014not a collection of disconnected parts.\nHeads Down, Building Forward: From Vision to Velocity\nWith this powerful foundation in place, our strategy is clear: we are heads-down, building. We recognize the hard truth that the old narrative-driven market is fading. As Kevin Liu recently shared, the biggest challenge facing all of crypto is the lack of real users. In his words, \u201cwe\u2019re exploring different directions \u2014 not because we\u2019re lost, but because we\u2019re searching for real product-market fit, real users, and real demand.\u201d\nOur flexible and pragmatic approach is a direct response to this reality. Through LazAI, we will \u201cexplore real-world application opportunities, such as AI + real-life use cases\u2026 The goal is simple: find real use cases with real users.\u201d This isn\u2019t just a plan; it\u2019s happening now.\nThe launch of CreateAI saw 20,000 pieces minted in just three hours. Lazbubu, our AI Companion DAT, attracted over 90,000 participants to its Whitelist Campaign, leading to more than 10,000 DAT mints. GMPayer, the first x402-powered multi-currency payment hub, is enabling AI agents to transact autonomously. These early results validate our strategy: by focusing on genuine product-market fit, we\u2019re cultivating an economy where usage directly reinforces value across the entire Metis stack.\nThe Beta Ground for Tomorrow\nIn a market obsessed with fleeting trends, the substantive work of building is often overlooked. Yet this is precisely where lasting value emerges\u2014not through zero-sum games that extract value, but through positive-sum ecosystems where new forms of value are born. We understand that market prices fluctuate, but our commitment is to a longer-term vision. The value we are creating is not measured in daily price charts but in the strength and utility of our infrastructure and the applications built upon it.\nI am confident that the market will eventually recognize the substance of what we are building together. I invite you to look beyond the noise, share in this conviction, and join us in building a future where technology and human purpose align. Thank you for being the architects of what comes next.\nHappy New Year to our incredible Metis community\uff01\nWith trust and clarity,\nNatalia Ameline\nDecentralization Coordinator, Metis",

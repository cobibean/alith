        "content": "Live Link: https://prototypelobbyfpoint.netlify.app/\nWe are thrilled to unveil a monumental leap in the development of Fracture Point, our upcoming tactical TPS game. While our interactive lobby prototype provides a glimpse into the player experience, the true revolution lies in the meticulously crafted on-chain smart contracts and the robust Alith Architecture that power our innovative Proof of Play ecosystem.\nThis past month has been dedicated to building the immutable bedrock of Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 capabilities, focusing on decentralized ownership, verifiable progression, and a player-driven economy.\nFracture Point: The Game Skill, Strategy, and True Digital Ownership\nFracture Point is designed as a high-octane, tactical third-person shooter that demands precision, strategic thinking, and teamwork. We are building a fiercely competitive environment where your skill and dedication are not just recognized, but are fundamentally integrated into the game\u2019s core value system.\nPrepare for:\nIntense FPS Combat: Master diverse weapon loadouts and tactical maneuvers in dynamic, high-stakes engagements.\nDeep Customization: Personalize your agents and unique \u201cvariants\u201d, making your mark on the battlefield.\nCompetitive Progression: Climb verifiable leaderboards, earn genuine rewards, and truly own your in-game achievements.\nThe Proof of Play Revolution: Rewarding Skill On-Chain\nOur commitment to Proof of Play is the defining feature of Fracture Point. This is not a concept; it\u2019s a core, on-chain mechanism ensuring that your active engagement and skillful performance directly translate into verifiable, immutable value and progression within the game\u2019s ecosystem.\nHow Proof of Play works in Fracture Point, powered by our contracts:\nVerifiable Achievements: Through the GameAchievementRegistry.sol contract (which is part of our ClaimManager system), your significant in-game achievements and progression milestones are immutably recorded on the blockchain. This provides transparent, provable recognition for your dedication and skill.\nSkill-Based Rewards: Our FPToken (FracturePoint Token), serving as XP, is minted to players based on their in-game performance (e.g., in Rift events), authorized exclusively by our trusted Alith Oracle. This ensures that rewards are earned through genuine gameplay.\nOn-Chain Progression & Badges: Your accumulated FPToken (XP) can then be burned via the ClaimManager contract to claim unique Rank Badges (ERC-721 NFTs) from the RankBadge.sol contract, signifying your seasonal achievements and skill tier. This process is entirely on-chain, making your rank verifiable and owned.\nPlayer-Driven Ecosystem: This interconnected system ensures that the game\u2019s economy and value are directly influenced and shaped by the collective activity and skilled contributions of its player base.\nThis ensures Fracture Point rewards genuine skill, time invested, and proven performance, fostering a fair, transparent, and truly player-owned gaming experience.\nOur Core Architecture: Dedicated Smart Contracts and The Alith Framework\nThe true innovation behind Fracture Point lies in its robust, interconnected smart contracts and the strategic implementation of the Alith Architecture.\n1. The Alith Architecture: Our Tailored Blockchain Game Framework\nFracture Point leverages a bespoke implementation of the Alith Architecture. This is our comprehensive, modular framework meticulously designed to seamlessly integrate blockchain technology without compromising gameplay performance. It intelligently separates:\nOn-Chain Components: Our smart contracts (FPToken, RankBadge, ClaimManager) handle critical, immutable data like XP (FPToken) balances, Rank Badge (NFT) ownership, and verifiable achievements. This ensures decentralization, security, and provable ownership. The Alith Oracle acts as the trusted off-chain authority that bridges game outcomes to on-chain actions, such as distributing XP and authorizing badge claims.\nOff-Chain Backend: High-frequency game logic, real-time matchmaking, complex physics calculations, and volatile player statistics run on a performant off-chain backend. This guarantees a smooth, low-latency, and responsive gameplay experience, unburdened by blockchain transaction times and gas costs.\nSecure Interoperability: A robust and auditable communication layer ensures seamless and secure data flow between our contracts (governed by the Alith Oracle) and the off-chain game server.\n2. Fracture Point\u2019s Core Smart Contracts (Audited & Interconnected)\nWe have successfully designed, developed, and prepared for deployment the foundational smart contracts that power Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 economy and the Proof of Play mechanics. These contracts work in concert:\nFPToken.sol (FuturePoint Token) : This ERC-20 token represents XP within the Fracture Point ecosystem. It\u2019s designed specifically for in-game progression:\nMinted by Alith Oracle: Only the designated alithOracle can mint new FPToken to players (e.g., via distributeRiftXP) based on game outcomes.\nBurned by ClaimManager: The ClaimManager contract is uniquely authorized to burn FPToken (XP) from player balances when they claim Rank Badges, creating a clear utility and economic loop.\nNon-Transferable (Player-to-Player): Significantly, direct player-to-player transfers of FPToken are disabled. This ensures FPToken remains a pure XP/progression token, preventing speculative trading and focusing its value on in-game achievement.\nRankBadge.sol (Fracture Point Rank Badge) : This ERC-721 NFT contract represents unique, season-specific Rank Badges that players can earn.\nMinted by ClaimManager: Only the ClaimManager contract is authorized to mint new Rank Badges to players, ensuring badges are earned through the proper Proof of Play mechanism.\nImmutable On-Chain Proof: Each badge is a unique NFT, providing verifiable, immutable proof of a player\u2019s achievement for a given season and rank.\nClaimManager.sol : This is the central orchestrator contract, linking FPToken (XP) to Rank Badges (NFTs) and acting as the bridge to the Alith Oracle.\nManages Badge Claims: Players claim badges via ClaimManager, which then verifies their XP balance, burns the necessary FPToken from their account, and instructs RankBadge.sol to mint the new NFT.\nSeason Management: It tracks the currentSeason, ensuring players can only claim one badge per season.\nKarma Evaluation Requests: It facilitates requests for off-chain \u201cKarma\u201d evaluations by the Alith Oracle, hinting at deeper player behavior analysis.\nAlith Oracle Integration: It designates and relies on the alithOracle for authorizing badge claims and distributing rewards based on verified game data.\nThe code for these foundational contracts and the full Alith Architecture implementation can be reviewed in our public repository: https://github.com/SUPAMAN-dev/fracture-point-hyperhack\nYou can also verify our currently deployed contract addresses on the Hyperion testnet network: https://hyperion-testnet.metisdevops.link/\nFPToken Address: 0xb4F4337A5660f42bC4D7fB735F18aB7b47E3CAf9\nClaimManager Address: 0xCc3B21510ef143F4b52f5e759C097c698F838e00\nRankBadge Address: 0xd557697c5C017d6Fdd76F778C1e2355AE3CCe15e\n(Note on GHC: While not currently on-chain, the fixed supply GHC currency, managed by multisig, will form the broader economic layer of Fracture Point. Its design ensures seamless future integration with our on-chain systems when the time is right, complementing the FPToken XP system.)\nLobby Prototype: The Player\u2019s Interactive Gateway\nComplementing this powerful blockchain backend, our functional lobby prototype provides the intuitive player-facing interface. It allows players to:\nSeamlessly navigate between game modes, customization options, and personal profiles.\nExperience a polished UI/UX that aligns with Fracture Point\u2019s futuristic theme.\nInteract with the foundational elements for future wallet integration, demonstrating how players will connect their on-chain assets to the game.\nLink to the prototype demo: https://youtu.be/aI_lQ6DcwEI\nEcosystem Interest: Strategic Offer from Plurality Web3\nAs a direct result of our development efforts during this Hyperion Hackathon, Fracture Point attracted partnership interest from leading Web3 infrastructure teams, most notably Plurality Web3, a startup pioneering embedded identity and authentication infrastructure for dApps.\nPlurality offered us a 12-month support package under their Partner Program, which includes:\n1:1 Engineering Support for seamless integration of user authentication and personalized in-game logic.\nFree infrastructure credits to cover authentication, user session tooling, and zkTLS-powered identity gating.\nUX Collaboration to co-design smooth onboarding flows without popups or clunky wallets particularly valuable for our casual-to-core player conversion goals.\nTheir outreach came after they reviewed Fracture Point\u2019s Hyperion-backed Proof of Play system and saw clear potential for adoption in competitive Web3 gaming.\nWe view this offer as both validation of our underlying architecture and a strategic complement to the low-cost, high-throughput infrastructure that Hyperion enables. These ecosystem synergies affirm that Fracture Point is not just a playable demo, but a platform being taken seriously by early infrastructure players.\nWhat\u2019s Next for Fracture Point?\nWith the core blockchain architecture, smart contracts, and the lobby interface firmly established, our immediate next steps are to integrate these powerful systems with the actual game engine to bring the full combat experience to life. This includes:\nBackend Game Logic Development: Building out the sophisticated off-chain systems for real-time matchmaking, secure player data management, and robust anti-cheat measures.\nGame Engine Integration: Connecting the lobby and backend systems to a game engine to render the immersive world and high-fidelity combat of Fracture Point.\nProof of Play Loop Refinement: Fully integrating in-game actions with our GameAchievementRegistry.sol via the Alith Oracle to ensure every skill-based action is verifiable and contributes to player progression and potential future GHC earnings.\nThis is an incredibly exciting time for Fracture Point.

Students and educators face the challenge of a rigid system that doesn\u2019t adapt to diverse needs, impacting learning outcomes.\nSolution Overview\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform offers a dynamic solution by employing a multi-agent system built on the Alith Agentic Framework. Specialized AI agents collaboratively analyze individual learning styles, curate tailored content, provide adaptive tutoring, and track progress in real time. This creates a uniquely personalized learning journey that adjusts to each student\u2019s needs and pace. By integrating diverse educational resources, the platform aims to enhance engagement, improve learning outcomes, and empower both students and educators.\nProject Description\nThis platform is designed to benefit a wide range of users across the educational landscape. Students of all ages, from kindergarten through higher education, can experience a more engaging and effective learning journey tailored to their specific needs. Educators can utilize the platform to enhance their teaching capabilities, gain deeper insights into student progress, and free up time for more individualized support.\nOn-Chain Components: A First-Class Implementation and Core Requirement for Blockchain Deployment\nOur AI-powered personalized education platform is not merely \u201cblockchain-enhanced\u201d \u2014 its core functionality and unique value proposition depend fundamentally on blockchain deployment via Hyperion. The decentralized, trustless, and immutable nature of blockchain\u2014particularly Hyperion\u2019s AI-optimized environment\u2014is essential to realizing our vision.\nOn-Chain Achievement Verification (Smart Contract Architecture)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain:\nThe LearningRecord.sol smart contract serves as an immutable, on-chain ledger for all student accomplishments.\nAchievement Mapping: The contract maintains a mapping from a user\u2019s wallet address to an array of Achievement structs, where each struct contains the moduleName and a timestamp.\nSecure, Off-Chain Verification: A secure, server-controlled wallet is the only address authorized to call the addAchievementWithSignature function. This ensures achievements are only recorded after the platform\u2019s backend has verified the user\u2019s quiz completion and signature.\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nTrustless & Immutable Credentials: By recording achievements on the Metis Hyperion testnet, we create a permanent, tamper-proof record of learning that is owned by the user and verifiable by anyone (e.g., employers, other institutions) without relying on a centralized database.\nData Sovereignty: Students retain full control of their learning data. On-chain metadata ensures ownership and transparency, unlike siloed centralized platforms.\nFoundation for a Trustless Ecosystem: This on-chain record is the foundational layer. While AI agents currently operate off-chain for performance, their most critical output\u2014the certification of learning\u2014is secured on the blockchain.\nAI Enablement via the Alith Agentic Framework\nWhat is Alith:\nAlith is a modular, multi-agent framework designed to power personalized learning by simulating human-like reasoning, memory, and collaboration among AI agents. It forms the intelligence layer of our platform, with deep interoperability with blockchain systems like Hyperion.\nKey Features of Alith (Implemented):\nAgent Management: Modular deployment of specialized AI agents:\nLearning Style Analyst (Implicit in course selection)\nContent Curator (AI Study Guide Generator)\nPersonalized Tutor (Quiz Hints & Tutor Chat)\nProgress Tracker (On-chain achievement logging)\nPersistent Memory: Agents maintain long-term memory and context across sessions (demonstrated in Telegram bot), enhancing personalization.\nToolchain Access: Seamless access to external APIs and knowledge bases for generating content and hints.\nBlockchain Integration with Alith:\nThe Alith agent framework operates off-chain to provide a responsive and intelligent user experience. The blockchain is used as the ultimate source of truth for the results of these AI interactions.\nVerifiable Outcomes: When a user successfully passes a quiz, the off-chain backend coordinates with the ProgressTrackerAgent to commit this achievement to the LearningRecord smart contract, creating an immutable record\u2705.\nFoundation for On-Chain Logic: The current architecture provides the groundwork for future enhancements where agent workflows could be triggered and validated by smart contracts.\nSecure, Real-Time AI Inference (Leveraging Hyperion\u2019s AI-Native Infrastructure)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain (or Hyperion-enabled):\nWhile heavy AI workloads (e.g., model training, long-form inference) run off-chain via the Alith framework, Hyperion enables:\nVerifiable AI Outputs: AI-driven assessments and tutor recommendations are validated off-chain, with the final \u201cproof-of-completion\u201d immutably stored on-chain. This ensures educational integrity and transparency\u2014unlike opaque, centralized AI systems.\nLow Latency, High Throughput: Hyperion\u2019s parallel execution environment supports the fast transaction finality needed to record achievements in near real-time, keeping learners engaged.\nData Sovereignty, Incentives, and Trust in Our Education Platform\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform leverages Hyperion\u2019s blockchain to give students true control over their learning data and foster a trusted educational environment.\nWallet-Based Identity and User Control\nIn our platform, a user\u2019s Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) serves as their identity. Authentication is handled securely via message signing, ensuring users control access to their accounts without traditional passwords. This wallet-centric approach is the first step toward a future of true data sovereignty, where learning profiles can be fully controlled by the user.\nImportance of Trust and Transparency\nIn education, trust and transparency are paramount:\nLearner Trust: Students need to trust that their achievements are real. On-chain verifiable credentials build this crucial trust.\nEmpowering Educators: Transparent data provides educators with reliable insights into student progress and curriculum effectiveness.\nEquity & Accessibility: Blockchain prevents fraud and offers a universal, trusted way for students to showcase skills, democratizing opportunities regardless of background.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nPeer Study Groups: Connect with others for collaborative discussions and support.\nQ&A Forums: Ask and answer subject-related questions to deepen understanding.\nSimulated Collaboration: Practice teamwork in virtual, project-based learning scenarios.\nOptional Mentorship: Receive guidance from experienced peers and educators.\nProgress Sharing (Privacy-Controlled): Share milestones to motivate peers while maintaining control over visibility.\nCommunity Challenges: Participate in gamified group activities to promote engagement and friendly competition.\nFuture Roadmap & Planned Enhancements\nThis MVP is the foundation for a much larger vision. Our planned enhancements include:\nToken-Based Incentives ($LP)\nIntroduce a utility token, LearnPoints ($LP), to create a Learn-to-Earn (L2E) model that rewards students for completing modules, mastering skills, and contributing to the community.\n$LP could be staked for premium features or used to vote on platform decisions, aligning community interests.\nDecentralized Agent Marketplace\nAllow community developers to contribute new agents (e.g., specialized tutors or regional content curators).\nAgents will be published and authenticated on-chain with verifiable capabilities.\nToken-based reputation and staking mechanisms will prevent misuse or malicious behavior.\nOn-Chain Agent Coordination & Composable Workflows\nEvolve our smart contract architecture to manage agent workflows directly, enabling fully trustless and transparent educational logic.\nEnable educators to compose reusable learning workflows by chaining agents together via simple declarative schemas, backed by on-chain validation.\nZK-Verifiable Inference\nIntegrate zkML (zero-knowledge machine learning) to enable cryptographic verification of off-chain AI outputs. This allows validators and institutions to confirm an agent\u2019s decision (e.g., a test score) without exposing the underlying model or input.\nMultilingual & Accessibility Agents\nCreate plug-and-play AI agents specialized in localization, translation, and neurodiverse learning strategies.\nTeam Members\n@amardeep\n@priyankg3\nGitHub\ngithub.com\nGitHub - amardeepio/Eduverse\nContribute to amardeepio/Eduverse development by creating an account on GitHub.\nVideo tutorial EduVerse tutorial video\nPresentation and future roadmap: Presentation and RoadMap",

From the beginning, our aim has been consistent: not to be another Layer 2, but to build infrastructure that evolves, experiments, and sets the direction for tomorrow. We began by scaling Ethereum and have steadily expanded toward a future where blockchain and AI move together.\nTraditional L2s need upgrading. That is why we built Hyperion, our AI-optimized infrastructure layer that raises throughput and lowers latency. But infrastructure alone is not enough. To bring communities in, we must layer playability and meaningful interactions on top.\nLazAI, our application and data layer, is where playability comes alive. It makes infrastructure interactive, aligns with market demand, and builds community confidence.\nMetis is the beta ground for new bets, the place where daring ideas are tested, refined, and scaled before they shape the industry at large. As we continue this path, we must grow together, anchored by trust and clarity.\nA Toolkit for One Economy: From Settlement to Playability\nMetis\u2019s strength is in its unity. We are not scattering value into silos; we are building a connected toolkit under one economy.\nAndromeda serves as the settlement and trading layer. Hyperion expands that base with scalable compute, optimized for AI dApps that demand high throughput and low latency. Together, they form the infrastructure. On top sits LazAI, serving as the application layer, transforming this foundation into playability, points, data, and AI-driven value.\nStep by step, the toolkit expands. Value builds as the layers connect. Recent milestones show this evolution in motion. Andromeda continues as the battle-tested motherchain. HyperHack drew more than 100 active Hyperion builders. LazAI Testnet launched with Lazbubu proving real playability. Our AI Companion DAT Lazbubu enrolled over 90k participants in the Whitelist Campaign and over 10,000 DAT mints.\nPutting Users First in the Journey\nParticipation begins with simple entry points that spark curiosity. From there, users move into richer experiences where AI, data, and community features make engagement meaningful.\nThe path is clear. LazAI incubates agents and applications through LazPad, while users earn, mint, and interact with data assets that mature into broader use cases on Andromeda. Lazbubu is the first step, showing how evolving AI Companions can anchor this journey.\nThese are not static NFTs, but AI agents that evolve over time, transforming innovation into experiences that align with market demand and foster confidence within our community.\nClosing\nAs I shared in a previous letter, our strength comes from trust and clarity. The earlier you take part in these new layers, the more your participation will guide their growth, and over time your efforts may be recognized in ways that matter.\nMetis is shaping the beta ground for the next era. With clear paths for participation through LazAI and Lazbubu, and with a culture that dares while staying principled, we are ready for what\u2019s next.\nThis is not the time to stand still. This is the time to lean in, experiment, and co-create the future.\nTogether, we will make Metis not just a network but the proving ground where tomorrow\u2019s breakthroughs are born.\n\u2014 Elena Sinelnikova",

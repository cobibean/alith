True loyalty, the kind that sustains a community through market volatility and beyond, is rooted in connection, purpose, and shared ownership. Here\u2019s how to build a community-driven brand that inspires enduring loyalty.\nGive Your Community a Stake in the Story\nA community that feels like mere observers will behave like tourists, engaging briefly, taking what they need, and moving on. To cultivate loyalty, invite your community to be active participants in your project\u2019s journey. Make them feel like builders, not just spectators. Involve them in shaping updates, decisions, and the project\u2019s direction. Whether through decentralized governance, open feedback channels, or collaborative initiatives, giving your community a sense of ownership fosters a deeper connection. When people feel their voices matter, they\u2019re more likely to stay invested for the long haul.\nMake Identity a Core Part of the Experience\nLoyalty thrives when your brand represents something bigger than a product or a trade. People want to feel proud to align with your project, to wear its identity as a badge of honor. Create a brand that resonates with their values and gives them a sense of belonging. When supporting your project feels like standing for a shared mission, whether it\u2019s financial sovereignty, innovation, or community empowerment, your audience will naturally become advocates. They\u2019ll defend your brand, promote it, and invite others to join, transforming your community into a self-sustaining force.\nKeep the Conversation Alive and Authentic\nSilence is the enemy of loyalty. A community that feels ignored or disconnected will drift away. Maintain an ongoing, human dialogue with your audience through regular updates, AMAs (Ask Me Anything sessions), or social media engagement. Avoid scripted, corporate announcements, people crave authenticity. Respond to their questions, acknowledge their concerns, and celebrate their contributions. When your community feels seen and heard, they\u2019re more likely to stay engaged and invested, even when the market cools or challenges arise.\nShow Up When It Matters Most\nLoyalty isn\u2019t forged in moments of triumph; it\u2019s built in the face of adversity. When things go wrong, a failed update, a market crash, or a technical glitch, your response defines your brand. Show up with transparency, communicate openly, and keep building in public. Share your challenges, outline your solutions, and demonstrate your commitment to the project\u2019s vision. These moments are when your community decides whether you\u2019re worth sticking with. By showing resilience and accountability, you prove that your project is more than a fleeting opportunity, t\u2019s a cause worth believing in.",

Decentralized doesn\u2019t mean unfiltered.\nAttribution is a Nightmare\nHow do we accurately track which datasets directly influenced a model\u2019s output especially in multi-source training scenarios? Without granular attribution, revenue-sharing quickly becomes speculative or unfair.\nGaming the System\nTokenized rewards always open the door to manipulation. Think botnets uploading synthetic data or feedback loops designed solely to trigger payout thresholds. This needs aggressive prevention design.\nLegal & Ethical Landmines\nIf a user uploads copyrighted or sensitive data, who\u2019s liable? The protocol? The contributors? The downstream AI project? Decentralization doesn\u2019t erase legal responsibility.\nRevenue Distribution Models Are Still Vague\nHow exactly will revenue be split between thousands of contributors? Based on access? Utility? Frequency of use? These formulas will need to be not only transparent but also defensible under scrutiny.h\nSo yes DATs might offer a new design space, but turning them into a reliable, abuse-resistant, and value-aligned mechanism for AI is far from solved.\nBuilders should proceed but with eyes wide open."

A few practical ways we can grow engagement and visibility in my opinion, which we are doing already at Metis:\n\u2022 Short-form builder stories (Vibe sessions). Builders connect with people, not just product updates but get live questions and Answer sessions with Metis Devrel and community\n\u2022 One thing i would love to see and working on it to make it happen is to run weekly digests or highlights from the forum. So we have some overview of what is happening on major areas\n\u2022 Recognize effort, not noise. Badges and points should reflect real value, not post count. Curated community highlights help. Weekly or bi-weekly digests showcasing forum posts, guild updates, or active contributors can go a long way.\nIf we want this to scale, the system has to be simple and that\u2019s what Hyperion Forum is about, consistent, and fairness are key.\nLet me know what you think"

Here are a few ideas I believe could make a real difference:\nSocial Media & Content Creation\n#BuiltOnHyperion Campaigns: Encourage devs and creators to share what they\u2019ve built, with visuals or demo videos\u2014could even turn into a recurring series.\nCreator Grants or Bounties for blog posts, tutorials, or videos explaining how to use parts of the Hyperion stack.\nShort-form video contests explaining Hyperion concepts in <60 seconds (e.g., reels, TikToks).\nEvents & Interactive Engagement\nHyperion Town Halls or Office Hours: Monthly check-ins with the team or contributors to align on priorities and share updates.\nThemed Community Weeks: For example, \u201cInfrastructure Week\u201d or \u201cGaming on Hyperion Week,\u201d where focused discussions, demos, and content happen.\nBuild & Earn hackathons (virtual or local) that encourage people to create tools, apps, or content.\nRewards, Recognition & Incentives\nHyperion XP System: Points for meaningful contributions (support, content, feedback, dev work), leading to levels, roles, and perks.\nDynamic badges/NFTs for community achievements\u2014like \u201cValidator,\u201d \u201cEarly Supporter,\u201d \u201cCommunity Helper,\u201d etc.\nLeaderboard Dashboards to publicly celebrate top contributors across categories.\nCampaign Ideas\n\u201cHelp Build the Hyperion Wiki\u201d: Incentivize community-led documentation, FAQs, or beginner guides.\nMonthly Contribution Challenges: e.g. \u201cWrite a guide,\u201d \u201cTranslate docs,\u201d or \u201cAnswer 10 questions on Discord.\u201d\nOverall, the more visible and valued contributions feel, the more people will want to get involved. Hyperion already has a strong tech foundation\u2014now it\u2019s about building a passionate, collaborative culture on top of it.\nWould love to hear if others have tried systems like these\u2014or have totally different approaches!"

What do you think are the most effective ways to increase community engagement? In areas like social media, content creation, events, or reward systems, what approaches could work best?\nAlso, how could we make community contributions more visible and rewarding-through badges, point systems, campaigns, or similar?\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and experiences if you\u2019re willing to share!\nGreat question! I think starting with small but fun reward systems (like badges or point leaderboards) always helps to motivate early contributors. Also, meme contests or short-form video campaigns on X/TG could really help bring more organic buzz to Hyperion"

        "content": "As a Developer Experience Lead at Metis, a Layer 2 blockchain focused on AI use cases, I\u2019ve had a front-row seat to the rapid evolution of developer advocacy in the blockchain space. Working at the intersection of crypto and AI has given me unique insights into how our industry is reshaping developer engagement and ecosystem growth strategies.\nMoving Beyond Traditional Web2 Developer Relations\nWhen I transitioned into blockchain developer advocacy, one of the first things I noticed was how fundamentally different this field is from traditional Web2 developer relations. My role at Metis differs significantly because of our focus on engaging communities through both direct and indirect financial incentives for participation.\nUnlike conventional developer relations that rely primarily on educational content and community building, we\u2019ve had to incorporate economic incentive structures as core engagement mechanisms. This isn\u2019t just about throwing money at developers - it\u2019s about creating sustainable economic models that align developer success with ecosystem growth.\nSolving the Retention Challenge: Beyond Grant Farming\nOne of my biggest challenges is not just onboarding developers, but retaining them within the ecosystem. The crypto space has a significant problem with \u201cgrant farming\u201d - developers who participate only for immediate financial rewards and then disappear.\nWe\u2019ve implemented what we call \u201cBuilder Mining Rewards\u201d - incentives focused on each individual application\u2019s performance in the network. This creates ongoing rewards based on actual usage rather than just participation. We\u2019re also working on incentive systems that allow developers to create their own campaigns for their products and socials. When developers participate in growing their own products, they have an incentive to grow with the ecosystem.\nHow We Measure Success: Multi-Dimensional Metrics\nMeasuring developer advocacy success in blockchain requires tracking both traditional and blockchain-specific indicators. We monitor off-chain metrics like followers and engagement rates, alongside on-chain metrics including transaction numbers and volume.\nThis dual approach gives us a more complete picture of our ecosystem health. Social engagement tells us about community interest and content effectiveness, while on-chain data shows us real economic activity and actual usage of what developers are building.\nTeaching Verifiable AI: A Unique Educational Challenge\nWorking at the intersection of crypto and AI has created entirely new educational challenges. I need to understand what the crypto industry is focused on, what the AI industry is focused on, and what people are actually using. Communicating why our product for verifiable AI interactions exists requires bridging multiple technical domains.\nTeaching developers the benefits of verifiable AI is actually straightforward - we host weekly developer workshops and update documentation frequently to showcase how the technology works. The bigger challenge is addressing misconceptions.\nThe biggest misconception I encounter is that verifiable AI should be applied to every use case. Unfortunately, in its current state, it\u2019s costly and difficult to build for every scenario. The most interesting use cases I see are security solutions leveraging AI for real-time detection, and simulation of economies in games that create interesting scenarios. Without verifiable execution, a provider sitting between the product and consumer could manipulate AI decisions.\nWhen explaining technical complexity, I focus on one key idea: verifiability. Whether we\u2019re using Trusted Execution Environments, Zero Knowledge Proofs, or On-Chain Verification, they all lead to the same core concept - giving developers and users verifiable means to understand AI model execution and the data used to achieve results.\nThe Power of Practical Examples\nThrough our workshops and documentation efforts, I\u2019ve learned that developers primarily need examples of how to use our products. Abstract explanations don\u2019t cut it in the high-stakes world of blockchain development where coding errors can result in permanent financial losses.\nOur goal is to include as many examples as possible to make integration very easy. We\u2019re also developing tools like Alith to simplify these integrations, even as the underlying technology continues evolving on testnet.\nThis preference for practical examples has shaped our entire content strategy. Rather than theoretical education, we focus on working code examples and integration patterns that developers can immediately implement and modify for their specific needs.\nBuilding Multi-Stakeholder Ecosystems\nOne trend I\u2019m particularly excited about is our move toward multi-stakeholder ecosystem design. During the HyperHack, we have initiatives tailored around rewarding participation from both developers and users. We have a campaign teaching developers to market their products to attract users, and another campaign rewarding user activity for interacting with applications.\nThis approach recognizes that sustainable ecosystems need more than just developers - they need active user communities. By incentivizing both sides of the equation, we create network effects that benefit everyone involved.\nThe Global Challenge\nUnlike traditional tech companies that might focus on specific geographic markets, we\u2019re engaging with truly global, 24/7 communities across diverse regulatory environments. This requires us to maintain presence across multiple channels - Twitter, YouTube, Discord, and comprehensive documentation - while being responsive to developers across all time zones.\nThe asynchronous nature of our community has pushed us to create robust self-service resources while still maintaining active community engagement. It\u2019s a balance between scalable education and personalized support.\nLooking Forward: Developer-Led Growth\nOne of the most promising trends I\u2019m seeing is the emergence of developer-led growth campaigns. We\u2019re creating systems that allow developers to become advocates for their own projects, providing them with tools and incentives to promote their applications while contributing to broader ecosystem growth.\nThis approach creates more authentic advocacy than centralized marketing efforts. Developers who build applications are naturally the best advocates for their specific use cases and can provide genuine insights that resonate with other builders.\nThe Evolution of Our Field\nWorking in blockchain developer advocacy today requires expertise across multiple domains - technical blockchain knowledge, community management, economic incentive design, and emerging technology integration. It\u2019s far more complex than traditional developer relations, but also more rewarding.\nThe convergence of AI and blockchain represents a particular opportunity for those of us who can navigate these complex educational challenges while building sustainable developer ecosystems. As verifiable AI technology matures and use cases become clearer, the work we\u2019re doing today is laying the foundation for the next wave of decentralized innovation.\nWhat excites me most is that we\u2019re not just building tools or communities - we\u2019re creating entirely new economic models for how developers, users, and platforms can all benefit from shared ecosystem growth. The financial incentive structures that initially seemed foreign are actually powerful tools for aligning interests and creating sustainable, long-term developer engagement.\nThe field has evolved from simple community building to sophisticated ecosystem development, and I believe we\u2019re just getting started. For blockchain startups entering this space, the companies that understand and adapt to these trends will be the ones that build the developer communities driving the future of decentralized technology.",

AI can help coordinate multi-sig signers in different time zones, manage task boards, or generate project updates for stakeholders. Less copy-pasting, more time spent on real problem-solving.\nAnd here\u2019s the thing that must be mentioned: AI\u2019s not replacing operator. it\u2019s freeing them up. It handles the repetitive grind so we can focus on strategic decisions, creative solutions, and keeping our projects moving forward.\nSo if you\u2019re in Web3 ops, the question isn\u2019t whether AI will affect your work, it\u2019s how you\u2019ll harness it to make your job easier and your projects even more successful.\nSo fellas, how do you see AI helping you stay on top of your operations game?"

                "comment": "Awesome summary of how AI is transforming operations, and a great question.\nI believe nothing will ever replace genuine, authentic human judgment when it comes to organizing a project\u2019s work. But AI is an incredibly powerful tool that makes our work more efficient, faster, and easier. For me, it\u2019s a huge time-saver and an always-available assistant, even when a crazy idea pops into my head in the middle of the night, I can instantly ask AI whether it\u2019s feasible.\nNothing can replace human-to-human interaction, with all the empathy and nuance it brings. But embracing AI as a tool to support your work can make your job smoother and a lot more enjoyable.\nAs I mentioned, one of the ways I use AI in my workflow is by sharing all possible information about the project and regularly discussing new features, updates, and any issues that arise. Over time, as it learns this context, AI becomes an even better and more effective assistant. In a way, we learn from each other."

        "content": "As the Developer Experience Lead at Metis, a Layer 2 blockchain project focused on AI integration, I\u2019ve witnessed firsthand how artificial intelligence is fundamentally transforming how developers approach blockchain development. We\u2019re not just seeing incremental improvements, we\u2019re experiencing a complete paradigm shift in how developers learn, build, and deploy applications in the Web3 space.\nAI as First-Class Infrastructure\nAt Metis, we\u2019ve made a strategic decision to treat AI as first-class infrastructure rather than an afterthought. This means AI isn\u2019t just a tool we use occasionally; it\u2019s deeply integrated into every aspect of our developer experience. From our documentation system that has access to all of Metis\u2019 data sources to Alith, our core AI agent framework, we\u2019ve built AI into the foundation of how developers interact with our ecosystem.\nThe impact has been transformative. Just as developers have long relied on boilerplate code to accelerate project development, AI has become the new boilerplate, a foundation where developers can rapidly add features and functions to solve specific problems. This shift has fundamentally changed the development workflow from lengthy setup processes to rapid iteration and deployment.\nThe Alith Framework: Redefining AI Agent Development\nOur flagship contribution to this transformation is Alith, Metis\u2019 main AI agent framework. Alith represents what we believe is the future of blockchain-AI integration, offering several key capabilities:\nLazAI Gateway provides comprehensive wallet management, transaction handling, and access to core privacy features like iDAO, DAT, and verified computing. This eliminates the complexity traditionally associated with blockchain wallet integration.\nMultiple Model Support ensures developers aren\u2019t locked into a single AI provider.

                "comment": "As the Developer Experience Lead at Metis, a Layer 2 blockchain project focused on AI integration, I\u2019ve witnessed firsthand how artificial intelligence is fundamentally transforming how developers approach blockchain development. We\u2019re not just seeing incremental improvements, we\u2019re experiencing a complete paradigm shift in how developers learn, build, and deploy applications in the Web3 space.\nAI as First-Class Infrastructure\nAt Metis, we\u2019ve made a strategic decision to treat AI as first-class infrastructure rather than an afterthought. This means AI isn\u2019t just a tool we use occasionally; it\u2019s deeply integrated into every aspect of our developer experience. From our documentation system that has access to all of Metis\u2019 data sources to Alith, our core AI agent framework, we\u2019ve built AI into the foundation of how developers interact with our ecosystem.\nThe impact has been transformative. Just as developers have long relied on boilerplate code to accelerate project development, AI has become the new boilerplate, a foundation where developers can rapidly add features and functions to solve specific problems. This shift has fundamentally changed the development workflow from lengthy setup processes to rapid iteration and deployment.\nThe Alith Framework: Redefining AI Agent Development\nOur flagship contribution to this transformation is Alith, Metis\u2019 main AI agent framework. Alith represents what we believe is the future of blockchain-AI integration, offering several key capabilities:\nLazAI Gateway provides comprehensive wallet management, transaction handling, and access to core privacy features like iDAO, DAT, and verified computing. This eliminates the complexity traditionally associated with blockchain wallet integration.\nMultiple Model Support ensures developers aren\u2019t locked into a single AI provider. We support both small models and large language models from providers like Llama, Grok, OpenAI, and Anthropic, giving developers flexibility in choosing the right tool for their specific use case.\nHigh Extensibility allows developers to customize everything from internal prompts to low-level API access. They can define roles, goals, tools, actions, and behaviors while maintaining clean abstraction layers.\nWorkflow Support enables complex orchestration patterns beyond simple sequential processes. Developers can implement hierarchical processes, conditional branching, and parallel execution\u2014crucial for sophisticated AI applications.\nCross-Language Support with SDKs for Rust, Python, and Node.js makes Alith accessible to developers regardless of their preferred programming language.\nHigh-Performance AI Training and Inference leverages Rust\u2019s performance advantages along with graph optimization, model compression, and JIT/AOT compilation with GPU coprocessors.\nWeb3 Friendly and Secure architecture provides out-of-the-box Web3 plugins that allow developers to securely integrate blockchain capabilities into TEE-based AI agent frameworks.\nVerifiable AI: The Missing Piece in Decentralized Development\nOne of the most critical innovations we\u2019re pioneering is verifiable AI.

                "comment": "Personally, I find it difficult to ignore the value of AI implementation I see it as a powerful augmentation toward building more refined and effective systems. A good example is how we designed Alith\u2019s integration into Fracture Point.\nCreating a fair ecosystem that supports the idea of Proof of Play would be nearly impossible without it. Without AI, you\u2019d need a human moderator present in every lobby of every match to ensure fair gameplay a logistical nightmare for any game at scale.\nBut with Alith woven into the system, it acts as a persistent, invisible moderator present in all lobbies simultaneously. It actively monitors player behavior, enforces fairness, and detects attempts to exploit the system in real time. This makes fairness scalable, and accountability automated.\nIt\u2019s not just AI for the sake of innovation it\u2019s AI as the foundation of trust."

                "comment": "Absolutely agree that the role of KOLs is evolving and fast. The shift toward community ownership and on-chain credibility is not just refreshing, it\u2019s necessary. But I also think centralized systems still have a role to play in supporting this transition, especially for emerging creators.\nPlatforms like Twitter/X, YouTube, and TikTok might be algorithm-driven, but they\u2019ve also taught KOLs how to build storytelling skills, cultivate audience loyalty, and create replicable engagement models. These systems, while flawed, provided the infrastructure that made many Web3-native voices visible in the first place.\nThe opportunity now is to bridge that centralized reach with decentralized ownership. KOLs who understand how to leverage both worlds those who use centralized platforms for discovery and decentralized ones for trust-building will dominate this next era.\nAlso, let\u2019s not overlook the potential for centralized platforms to evolve. We\u2019re already seeing integrations like token gating, digital collectibles, and off-platform DAOs being linked via social bios and communities. It\u2019s not an either/or it\u2019s about stacking influence across multiple layers.\nWeb3 KOLs aren\u2019t ditching their past tools they\u2019re just using them smarter.\nI am curious to see who\u2019s doing this well already. Any standout examples?"

The idea that KOLs are becoming community builders rather than just content creators makes a lot of sense and it should be like this in the decentralized era. The focus on credibility, on-chain reputation, and verifiable value creation is a positive evolution.\nHowever, I think we should proceed carefully and always DYOR when it comes to tokenized influence, especially with tokens launched randomly by them or communities leaders."

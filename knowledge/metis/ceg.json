        "content": "As a Developer Experience Lead at Metis, a Layer 2 blockchain focused on AI use cases, I\u2019ve had a front-row seat to the rapid evolution of developer advocacy in the blockchain space. Working at the intersection of crypto and AI has given me unique insights into how our industry is reshaping developer engagement and ecosystem growth strategies.\nMoving Beyond Traditional Web2 Developer Relations\nWhen I transitioned into blockchain developer advocacy, one of the first things I noticed was how fundamentally different this field is from traditional Web2 developer relations. My role at Metis differs significantly because of our focus on engaging communities through both direct and indirect financial incentives for participation.\nUnlike conventional developer relations that rely primarily on educational content and community building, we\u2019ve had to incorporate economic incentive structures as core engagement mechanisms. This isn\u2019t just about throwing money at developers - it\u2019s about creating sustainable economic models that align developer success with ecosystem growth.\nSolving the Retention Challenge: Beyond Grant Farming\nOne of my biggest challenges is not just onboarding developers, but retaining them within the ecosystem. The crypto space has a significant problem with \u201cgrant farming\u201d - developers who participate only for immediate financial rewards and then disappear.\nWe\u2019ve implemented what we call \u201cBuilder Mining Rewards\u201d - incentives focused on each individual application\u2019s performance in the network. This creates ongoing rewards based on actual usage rather than just participation. We\u2019re also working on incentive systems that allow developers to create their own campaigns for their products and socials. When developers participate in growing their own products, they have an incentive to grow with the ecosystem.\nHow We Measure Success: Multi-Dimensional Metrics\nMeasuring developer advocacy success in blockchain requires tracking both traditional and blockchain-specific indicators. We monitor off-chain metrics like followers and engagement rates, alongside on-chain metrics including transaction numbers and volume.\nThis dual approach gives us a more complete picture of our ecosystem health. Social engagement tells us about community interest and content effectiveness, while on-chain data shows us real economic activity and actual usage of what developers are building.\nTeaching Verifiable AI: A Unique Educational Challenge\nWorking at the intersection of crypto and AI has created entirely new educational challenges. I need to understand what the crypto industry is focused on, what the AI industry is focused on, and what people are actually using. Communicating why our product for verifiable AI interactions exists requires bridging multiple technical domains.\nTeaching developers the benefits of verifiable AI is actually straightforward - we host weekly developer workshops and update documentation frequently to showcase how the technology works. The bigger challenge is addressing misconceptions.\nThe biggest misconception I encounter is that verifiable AI should be applied to every use case. Unfortunately, in its current state, it\u2019s costly and difficult to build for every scenario. The most interesting use cases I see are security solutions leveraging AI for real-time detection, and simulation of economies in games that create interesting scenarios. Without verifiable execution, a provider sitting between the product and consumer could manipulate AI decisions.\nWhen explaining technical complexity, I focus on one key idea: verifiability. Whether we\u2019re using Trusted Execution Environments, Zero Knowledge Proofs, or On-Chain Verification, they all lead to the same core concept - giving developers and users verifiable means to understand AI model execution and the data used to achieve results.\nThe Power of Practical Examples\nThrough our workshops and documentation efforts, I\u2019ve learned that developers primarily need examples of how to use our products. Abstract explanations don\u2019t cut it in the high-stakes world of blockchain development where coding errors can result in permanent financial losses.\nOur goal is to include as many examples as possible to make integration very easy. We\u2019re also developing tools like Alith to simplify these integrations, even as the underlying technology continues evolving on testnet.\nThis preference for practical examples has shaped our entire content strategy. Rather than theoretical education, we focus on working code examples and integration patterns that developers can immediately implement and modify for their specific needs.\nBuilding Multi-Stakeholder Ecosystems\nOne trend I\u2019m particularly excited about is our move toward multi-stakeholder ecosystem design. During the HyperHack, we have initiatives tailored around rewarding participation from both developers and users. We have a campaign teaching developers to market their products to attract users, and another campaign rewarding user activity for interacting with applications.\nThis approach recognizes that sustainable ecosystems need more than just developers - they need active user communities. By incentivizing both sides of the equation, we create network effects that benefit everyone involved.\nThe Global Challenge\nUnlike traditional tech companies that might focus on specific geographic markets, we\u2019re engaging with truly global, 24/7 communities across diverse regulatory environments. This requires us to maintain presence across multiple channels - Twitter, YouTube, Discord, and comprehensive documentation - while being responsive to developers across all time zones.\nThe asynchronous nature of our community has pushed us to create robust self-service resources while still maintaining active community engagement. It\u2019s a balance between scalable education and personalized support.\nLooking Forward: Developer-Led Growth\nOne of the most promising trends I\u2019m seeing is the emergence of developer-led growth campaigns. We\u2019re creating systems that allow developers to become advocates for their own projects, providing them with tools and incentives to promote their applications while contributing to broader ecosystem growth.\nThis approach creates more authentic advocacy than centralized marketing efforts. Developers who build applications are naturally the best advocates for their specific use cases and can provide genuine insights that resonate with other builders.\nThe Evolution of Our Field\nWorking in blockchain developer advocacy today requires expertise across multiple domains - technical blockchain knowledge, community management, economic incentive design, and emerging technology integration. It\u2019s far more complex than traditional developer relations, but also more rewarding.\nThe convergence of AI and blockchain represents a particular opportunity for those of us who can navigate these complex educational challenges while building sustainable developer ecosystems. As verifiable AI technology matures and use cases become clearer, the work we\u2019re doing today is laying the foundation for the next wave of decentralized innovation.\nWhat excites me most is that we\u2019re not just building tools or communities - we\u2019re creating entirely new economic models for how developers, users, and platforms can all benefit from shared ecosystem growth. The financial incentive structures that initially seemed foreign are actually powerful tools for aligning interests and creating sustainable, long-term developer engagement.\nThe field has evolved from simple community building to sophisticated ecosystem development, and I believe we\u2019re just getting started. For blockchain startups entering this space, the companies that understand and adapt to these trends will be the ones that build the developer communities driving the future of decentralized technology.",

Not every question needs a Zoom call. Record Looms. Use GitHub issues. Let conversations breathe.\nMake great docs the front door. Your support starts with your documentation. Is it clear, findable, and friendly?\nRotate office hours. Don\u2019t let your \u201clive\u201d moments cater to just one region. Rotate AMAs or dev hangouts across time zones \u2014 Asia, EU, Americas.\nLet your community shine. Empower devs to help each other. Community champions, moderators, or regional advocates can cut response time way down.\nTrack unresolved issues. Not everything gets solved in a Discord thread. Use ClickUp, GitHub Projects, or even a simple Notion table to follow up.\nTools we\u2019ve leaned on:\nLoom & Notion for async clarity\nDiscord with bots + tagging for follow-ups\nWorldTimeBuddy for timezone sanity\nClickUp or Linear for internal task tracking\nGitBook for community-first docs\nGlobal teams need intentional support systems. It\u2019s not just about speed \u2014 it\u2019s about clarity, consistency, and care.\nIf you\u2019ve cracked something that works across time zones, I\u2019d love to hear what\u2019s worked for you!",

                "comment": "Supporting Developers Across Time Zones Isn\u2019t Just a Challenge \u2014 It\u2019s an Opportunity.\nAs communities grow global, your support strategy can\u2019t rely on being online 9\u20135 in one time zone anymore.\nWe\u2019ve learned that real developer support means meeting people where they are \u2014 not just geographically, but culturally and contextually .\nSo here are a few things that actually work when you\u2019re trying to support a global dev audience (without burning out):\nTips that save time & sanity:\nDefault to async. Not every question needs a Zoom call. Record Looms. Use GitHub issues. Let conversations breathe.\nMake great docs the front door. Your support starts with your documentation. Is it clear, findable, and friendly?\nRotate office hours. Don\u2019t let your \u201clive\u201d moments cater to just one region. Rotate AMAs or dev hangouts across time zones \u2014 Asia, EU, Americas.\nLet your community shine. Empower devs to help each other. Community champions, moderators, or regional advocates can cut response time way down.\nTrack unresolved issues. Not everything gets solved in a Discord thread. Use ClickUp, GitHub Projects, or even a simple Notion table to follow up.\nTools we\u2019ve leaned on:\nLoom & Notion for async clarity\nDiscord with bots + tagging for follow-ups\nWorldTimeBuddy for timezone sanity\nClickUp or Linear for internal task tracking\nGitBook for community-first docs\nGlobal teams need intentional support systems. It\u2019s not just about speed \u2014 it\u2019s about clarity, consistency, and care.\nIf you\u2019ve cracked something that works across time zones, I\u2019d love to hear what\u2019s worked for you!"

By \u201cprogressive training\u201d I mean starting simple and gradually getting more sophisticated.\nThe plan is:\nStart with basic rule-based models (detecting large transfers, unusual patterns, etc.)\nAdd new detection rules as we gather more data\nUse a proxy contract pattern - deploy new model versions separately, test them, then switch a pointer to the new version\nKeep old versions as backup in case we need to rollback\nHonestly since I\u2019m pretty new to this, I\u2019ll probably start with just adjustable parameters that don\u2019t require full redeployment, then work up to more complex model swapping as I figure out Hyperion\u2019s capabilities."

AI can be helpful \u2014 answering frequently asked questions, sharing official links, or providing updated project information. But the presence of human admins is always crucial.\nWhat often makes it worse is when humans start mimicking bots themselves, replying with scripted, impersonal messages. Authentic, organic communication matters. It\u2019s about speaking not just on behalf of the project or the team but on behalf of the community too.\nIt means sharing your ups and downs, asking for support when you need it, and offering support when others do.\nEmpathy, compassion, and authenticity are what make any interaction feel real \u2014 and what ultimately builds trust."

It can save us a lot of time and effort, but we shouldn\u2019t rely on it too much.\nWhile AI can handle a lot of tasks, depending entirely on it isn\u2019t the best option. If we reduce human involvement too much, it could have negative effects, both economically and socially. We still need humans to control and guide the technology.

        "content": "Haithe\nA Decentralized Protocol for Verifiable AI.\nThe Problem\nThe core challenge for AI in Web3 isn\u2019t just proving that data hasn\u2019t been tampered with; it\u2019s proving the data\u2019s substance. A cryptographic hash can guarantee a dataset\u2019s integrity, but it cannot verify its origin, quality, or content. A creator could claim their AI is trained on financial data when it was actually trained on irrelevant information, and the hash would still be valid.\nThis \u201csemantic gap\u201d creates a trust vacuum, preventing developers from confidently building high-stakes applications that rely on third-party AI agents.\nThe Solution\nHaithe is a trust protocol that solves this problem by creating a transparent, verifiable ecosystem for AI. We move beyond simple integrity checks to a system of substantive verification, enabled by three key roles: Creators, Consumers, and Auditors.\nInstead of just registering a data hash, creators submit a detailed Claim Manifest about their dataset. Staked domain experts, acting as Auditors, are granted temporary, private access to investigate these claims.

                "comment": "Haithe\nA Decentralized Protocol for Verifiable AI.\nThe Problem\nThe core challenge for AI in Web3 isn\u2019t just proving that data hasn\u2019t been tampered with; it\u2019s proving the data\u2019s substance. A cryptographic hash can guarantee a dataset\u2019s integrity, but it cannot verify its origin, quality, or content. A creator could claim their AI is trained on financial data when it was actually trained on irrelevant information, and the hash would still be valid.\nThis \u201csemantic gap\u201d creates a trust vacuum, preventing developers from confidently building high-stakes applications that rely on third-party AI agents.\nThe Solution\nHaithe is a trust protocol that solves this problem by creating a transparent, verifiable ecosystem for AI. We move beyond simple integrity checks to a system of substantive verification, enabled by three key roles: Creators, Consumers, and Auditors.\nInstead of just registering a data hash, creators submit a detailed Claim Manifest about their dataset. Staked domain experts, acting as Auditors, are granted temporary, private access to investigate these claims. Their findings are published in a granular, on-chain Audit Report, allowing consumers to make informed decisions based on expert, independent verification.\nHow It Works: A Three-Part Ecosystem\nHaithe\u2019s workflow ensures checks and balances between all participants, with smart contracts on Hyperion orchestrating the process.\n1.

                "comment": "GM GM, Apologies for the delayed response , I was in the middle of relocating and just got everything settled. Thanks again for your interest in our project and for the thoughtful questions. Let me address each of them below\n1) If the dataset is private, how do you ensure Auditors don\u2019t misuse or leak it?\nGreat question. In our current model, auditors must undergo two layers of validation before they\u2019re granted access:\nFirst, they are verified by us (the platform) based on identity and domain expertise.\nSecond, they are validated by the DAO, ensuring community-level accountability.\nWhile trust in auditors is still required to some extent, just like in real-world auditing , we are actively exploring ways to make this process more trustless.\n2) Are Creators allowed to challenge an audit report if they think it\u2019s unfair or inaccurate?\nYes, it\u2019s a crucial safeguard.\nWe agree that auditors shouldn\u2019t have unchecked authority. Creators will have the ability to challenge audit reports, either by:\nRequesting a re-audit (potentially by a different auditor or group of auditors), or\nSubmitting a formal rebuttal that gets appended to the audit report for transparency.\n3) What kinds of use cases are you targeting first \u2013 trading bots, oracles, LLMs?\nOur initial focus is on trading bots and LLMs. These use cases have both high impact and urgent need for trust and verifiability."

                "comment": "Helloo, Apologies for the delayed response, I really appreciate your thoughtful question!\nAs a consumer, audits are exactly what enable trust that an AI agent\u2019s data truly comes from the sources claimed. Each audit report goes into technical detail, verifying every claim made in the agent\u2019s Claim Manifest \u2014 like the data source, date range, schema, and more.\nAnd yes, confidence naturally increases when multiple auditors review the same dataset. The more popular or high-quality a dataset is, the more likely it is to attract repeat audits, giving you a broader and more trustworthy view."

        "content": "Armando Pantoja:\nWe\u2019re here with a very special guest, Natalia Ameline, founder of Crypto Chicks & the Decentralization Coordinator at the Metis Foundation, where she\u2019s focused on building scalable Web3 infrastructure. How are you doing today?\nNatalia Ameline:\nI\u2019m doing great. Thank you for inviting me. I\u2019m super excited to share what we\u2019ve been working on at the Metis Foundation.\nArmando Pantoja:\nEthereum has changed everything \u2014 not only finance, but also the ability for people around the world to build tools, products, services, and DeFi applications on an open platform. You\u2019re now working deeply in decentralization and AI yourself, including LazAI. Can you tell us about what you\u2019re building?\nNatalia Ameline:\nEthereum gave opportunities to many, and it gave opportunities to me as well. I work at the Metis Foundation. Metis is the entity behind innovation in the Metis ecosystem. We started by launching Metis Layer 2 Andromeda, a scaling solution for Ethereum.\nWe\u2019ve never shied away from innovative, non\u2013cookie-cutter solutions. For example, Metis was the first Layer 2 to implement a decentralized sequencing network, which significantly strengthens decentralization across the ecosystem. There\u2019s been a lot of discussion recently about decentralizing sequencers, and now other Layer 2 ecosystems are starting to follow the approach we implemented years ago.\nAnother innovation is Hyperion, our AI-optimized L2 infrastructure with very high throughput and low latency. LazAI is our full-stack infrastructure designed to make AI ownable, rewarding, transparent, and playable. We\u2019re also home to a zero-knowledge company that develops verifiable computing technology used to power ZK proofs, which is foundational for LazAI. In addition, we launched GOAT Network, the first Bitcoin L2 ZK rollup with real yield. All of these platforms deliver deeply innovative solutions that are foundational to what we\u2019re building.\nArmando Pantoja:\nYou\u2019re clearly on the cutting edge of blockchain. Could you explain the difference between a one-off application and the foundational infrastructure you\u2019re building?\nNatalia Ameline:\nMany AI projects focus on single use cases and often rely on centralized solutions. LazAI is different. We\u2019re building a full-stack, modular infrastructure layer for decentralized AI.\nWe provide tools like the LazAI SDK, which enables developers to build complex solutions with ease. We also introduce assetization through Data Anchoring Tokens, or DATs, and support AI governance. Human governance over AI development is critically important, and our infrastructure is designed to address that concern.\nAnother key feature is verified computing, which enables verifiability across the entire AI lifecycle\u2014 from data provenance to ownership \u2014 all on-chain. This foundation allows developers, businesses, and communities to build scalable, auditable, and private AI systems without relying on centralized black-box platforms.\nArmando Pantoja:\nMy audience includes a lot of investors and creators who want to earn beyond simply buying and selling assets. How does tokenizing data through DATs create passive income opportunities?\nNatalia Ameline:\nOne of the biggest problems today is that large AI companies are hoarding user data and using it to train models without compensating creators. In many cases, users even pay to access models trained on their own data. We\u2019re already seeing backlash, including major lawsuits, which shows how broken the incentive structure is.\nWith Data Anchoring Tokens, your data becomes an asset. A dataset or a model can be tokenized with immutable, verifiable provenance recorded on-chain. Ownership and usage rights are clearly defined and remain under your control.\nWhen developers or AI agents use your data, you automatically earn rewards. These can take the form of royalties, licensing fees, or usage-based payouts. This allows contributors to build passive income while maintaining full privacy and control over how their assets are used.\nArmando Pantoja:\nMy background is in cryptography and software security, so trust is extremely important to me. AI systems are becoming increasingly centralized. How does verified computing ensure trust and transparency?\nNatalia Ameline:\nTrust, decentralization, and privacy are at the core of LazAI. We combine trusted execution environments for hardware-grade security, zero-knowledge proofs for privacy, and on-chain audit trails for transparency.\nYou don\u2019t need to trust a company or an individual. Contributors can prove how their data is used, and users can verify AI outputs without exposing private information. We completely remove human trust from the equation and rely instead on math, cryptography, and public blockchain ledgers.\nArmando Pantoja:\nHow does LazAI help set the stage for a sustainable, decentralized AI economy?\nNatalia Ameline:\nFrom day one, our vision has been to build the backbone of a Web3 economy. Metis infrastructure is not built in silos \u2014 it\u2019s interconnected and strategic.\nAndromeda acts as the settlement and execution layer. Hyperion expands that foundation by providing AI-optimized compute with high throughput and low latency. Together, they form a decentralized infrastructure layer.\nLazAI sits on top as the intelligence layer. It enables ownership, governance, rewards, and AI-driven automation. This ensures AI is transparent, fair, community-owned, and enterprise-ready, with Metis serving as the backbone of the Web3 economy.\nArmando Pantoja:\nYou recently launched a testnet. Can you walk us through that stage of development?\nNatalia Ameline:\nThe LazAI testnet is our first public milestone. It gives the community hands-on access to the ecosystem \u2014 building with the LazAI SDK, using APIs, minting DATs, verifying computation, and accessing on-chain inference.\nWe launched with LazBoo, an AI companion DAT. These AI agents have memory and personality and are designed for long-term interaction and value creation. They evolve over time through user interaction.\nSo far, more than 90,000 participants joined the whitelist campaign, and over 10,000 DATs were minted. That level of engagement has been a major success for us. We\u2019re continuing to refine the platform based on what we learn from the testnet and the community.\nArmando Pantoja:\nWhere can people learn more about you and what you\u2019re working on?\nNatalia Ameline:\nYou can explore the Metis Foundation, but for LazAI specifically, you can follow LazAI Network on Twitter or visit lazai.network. We also publish regular updates and deep dives on our blog.\nArmando Pantoja:\nThank you so much for joining us today. It was a pleasure.\nNatalia Ameline:\nThank you very much. Have a nice day.",

They assume that governments can perpetually inject new resources into the system. In reality, this assumption is increasingly fragile.\nWhat if the problem is not distribution, but circulation?\nThe Structural Failure of Modern Capitalism\nModern economies suffer from a paradox:\nProductivity continues to rise.\nTechnological efficiency accelerates.\nYet purchasing power stagnates or declines for large segments of society.\nCapital accumulates faster than it circulates.\nWhen money stops moving, economies do not collapse immediately. Instead, they hollow out. Consumption becomes debt-driven, political polarization intensifies, and social trust erodes.\nThis is not a moral failure.\nIt is a structural one.\nCapitalism depends on circulation. Without it, even abundant wealth becomes inert.\nWhy One-Time Redistribution Fails\nMost welfare systems and even many basic income models focus on one-way transfer:\nTax \u2192 State \u2192 Citizen\nDebt \u2192 Spending \u2192 Growth\nBut one-way flows are inherently unstable. They require constant external input and invite political resistance.\nA sustainable system cannot depend on endless injection.\nIt must recycle value internally.\nThis is where the concept of a circulating basic income diverges fundamentally from existing models.\nThe Principle of Circulation\nA circulating basic income rests on three simple principles:\nUniversal Distribution\nEvery individual receives a fixed amount regularly, without conditions.\nPartial Mandatory Circulation\nWhen the income is used, a predefined portion automatically returns to the system.\nFixed Recovery Rate\nThe recovery rate is not adjustable at will. It is structurally constant, ensuring stability.\nIn mathematical terms, the system resembles a closed loop rather than a faucet.\nMoney is not consumed and discarded.\nIt moves.\nWhy the Recovery Rate Must Be Fixed\nA critical insight of the circulating model is this:\nIf recovery rates fluctuate freely, circulation collapses.\nJust as physical systems require conservation laws, economic circulation requires invariant parameters.\nDistribution may vary slightly with population or GDP.\nTiming may adapt.\nBut the recovery ratio itself must remain stable.\nThis prevents inflationary spirals, political manipulation, and capital hoarding.\nIn short, stability is not enforced by authority, but by structure.\nIncentives Without Coercion\nOne of the most persistent critiques of basic income is that it discourages work.\nThe circulating model addresses this not through moral judgment, but design:\nIncome is unconditional.\nBut full consumption without participation is structurally impossible.\nThe more one participates in the economy, the more one benefits from circulation.\nThose who consume more contribute more back into the system automatically.\nThis is redistribution without punishment.\nBeyond Welfare: A Systemic Upgrade\nIt is crucial to emphasize:\nA circulating basic income is not welfare.\nIt does not replace existing social programs.\nIt does not target poverty alone.\nIt does not depend on moral deservingness.\nInstead, it functions as economic infrastructure, comparable to roads or electricity\u2014enabling activity rather than dictating behavior.\nWhy This Model Becomes Inevitable\nAutomation, AI, and superintelligent systems will continue to increase productivity while reducing the need for human labor.\nThis creates a structural mismatch:\nValue is created without wages.\nMarkets still require consumers.\nAttempts to preserve the wage-based distribution system indefinitely are increasingly artificial.\nAt some point, societies must choose:\nEither continuously patch the system with debt and emergency transfers, or\nRedesign circulation itself.\nThe latter is not radical.\nIt is pragmatic.\nA System Compatible With Human Freedom\nPerhaps most importantly, a circulating basic income does not require centralized micromanagement.\nOnce the parameters are set, the system self-regulates.\nIt does not need to judge citizens.\nIt does not need to predict behavior.\nIt does not need constant political intervention.\nIn an age where even artificial intelligence systems are being designed around stability constraints rather than moral intent, this matters.\nA stable system that preserves freedom is not built on trust in authority, but on transparent structure.\nConclusion: From Redistribution to Circulation\nThe debate around basic income has been stuck at the level of ethics and affordability.\nThe next step is structural.\nA circulating basic income reframes the question:\nNot \u201cCan we afford to give people money?\u201d\nBut \u201cCan we afford a system where money no longer moves?\u201d\nIn a world of increasing abundance and decreasing circulation, the answer is becoming clear.",

It is structurally constant, ensuring stability.\nIn mathematical terms, the system resembles a closed loop rather than a faucet.\nMoney is not consumed and discarded.\nIt moves.\nWhy the Recovery Rate Must Be Fixed\nA critical insight of the circulating model is this:\nIf recovery rates fluctuate freely, circulation collapses.\nJust as physical systems require conservation laws, economic circulation requires invariant parameters.\nDistribution may vary slightly with population or GDP.\nTiming may adapt.\nBut the recovery ratio itself must remain stable.\nThis prevents inflationary spirals, political manipulation, and capital hoarding.\nIn short, stability is not enforced by authority, but by structure.\nIncentives Without Coercion\nOne of the most persistent critiques of basic income is that it discourages work.\nThe circulating model addresses this not through moral judgment, but design:\nIncome is unconditional.\nBut full consumption without participation is structurally impossible.\nThe more one participates in the economy, the more one benefits from circulation.\nThose who consume more contribute more back into the system automatically.\nThis is redistribution without punishment.\nBeyond Welfare: A Systemic Upgrade\nIt is crucial to emphasize:\nA circulating basic income is not welfare.\nIt does not replace existing social programs.\nIt does not target poverty alone.\nIt does not depend on moral deservingness.\nInstead, it functions as economic infrastructure, comparable to roads or electricity\u2014enabling activity rather than dictating behavior.\nWhy This Model Becomes Inevitable\nAutomation, AI, and superintelligent systems will continue to increase productivity while reducing the need for human labor.\nThis creates a structural mismatch:\nValue is created without wages.\nMarkets still require consumers.\nAttempts to preserve the wage-based distribution system indefinitely are increasingly artificial.\nAt some point, societies must choose:\nEither continuously patch the system with debt and emergency transfers, or\nRedesign circulation itself.\nThe latter is not radical.\nIt is pragmatic.\nA System Compatible With Human Freedom\nPerhaps most importantly, a circulating basic income does not require centralized micromanagement.\nOnce the parameters are set, the system self-regulates.\nIt does not need to judge citizens.\nIt does not need to predict behavior.\nIt does not need constant political intervention.\nIn an age where even artificial intelligence systems are being designed around stability constraints rather than moral intent, this matters.\nA stable system that preserves freedom is not built on trust in authority, but on transparent structure.\nConclusion: From Redistribution to Circulation\nThe debate around basic income has been stuck at the level of ethics and affordability.\nThe next step is structural.\nA circulating basic income reframes the question:\nNot \u201cCan we afford to give people money?\u201d\nBut \u201cCan we afford a system where money no longer moves?\u201d\nIn a world of increasing abundance and decreasing circulation, the answer is becoming clear."

Lazbubu, our AI Companion DAT, attracted over 90,000 participants to its Whitelist Campaign, leading to more than 10,000 DAT mints.

We understand that market prices fluctuate, but our commitment is to a longer-term vision. The value we are creating is not measured in daily price charts but in the strength and utility of our infrastructure and the applications built upon it.\nI am confident that the market will eventually recognize the substance of what we are building together.

Their CEO summed it up: strong, local AI infrastructure is key for resilience, growth, and keeping pace in the new industrial era.\nThis also fits the UK government\u2019s ambition to lead in AI.

        "content": "Most projects in crypto still treat marketing like a megaphone: shout about token listings, hype up APYs, drop a few memes, then hope the crowd sticks around. It works for a moment, but rarely builds lasting traction.\nThe truth is, crypto marketing is different from Web2 for three reasons:\nCommunity > Customers\nIn traditional startups, you market to customers. In crypto, you\u2019re building a movement. People aren\u2019t just buying your product, they\u2019re buying into your story, governance, and upside.\nTransparency Cuts Both Ways\nEverything is on-chain. Wins spread fast, but mistakes spread faster. Communities expect radical honesty. Trying to \u201cspin\u201d things usually backfires.\nAttention is Fragmented\nYour users are on Twitter, Discord, Telegram, Farcaster, Reddit, and 10 other platforms at once. You can\u2019t control the channels. You have to create stories people want to carry for you.\nSo what actually works?\nNarrative-first marketing: Instead of \u201cwe launched a DEX,\u201d frame it as \u201cwe\u2019re fixing broken liquidity.\u201d People rally behind problems, not products.\nCommunity-led growth: Reward users for teaching, testing, and spreading the word. Airdrops are fine, but recognition and involvement often go further.\nConsistency beats hype: One well-timed weekly update will outlast ten noisy daily announcements. Projects that survive bear markets are usually the ones that stay visible and reliable.",

                "comment": "Most projects in crypto still treat marketing like a megaphone: shout about token listings, hype up APYs, drop a few memes, then hope the crowd sticks around. It works for a moment, but rarely builds lasting traction.\nThe truth is, crypto marketing is different from Web2 for three reasons:\nCommunity > Customers\nIn traditional startups, you market to customers. In crypto, you\u2019re building a movement. People aren\u2019t just buying your product, they\u2019re buying into your story, governance, and upside.\nTransparency Cuts Both Ways\nEverything is on-chain. Wins spread fast, but mistakes spread faster. Communities expect radical honesty. Trying to \u201cspin\u201d things usually backfires.\nAttention is Fragmented\nYour users are on Twitter, Discord, Telegram, Farcaster, Reddit, and 10 other platforms at once. You can\u2019t control the channels. You have to create stories people want to carry for you.\nSo what actually works?\nNarrative-first marketing: Instead of \u201cwe launched a DEX,\u201d frame it as \u201cwe\u2019re fixing broken liquidity.\u201d People rally behind problems, not products.\nCommunity-led growth: Reward users for teaching, testing, and spreading the word. Airdrops are fine, but recognition and involvement often go further.\nConsistency beats hype: One well-timed weekly update will outlast ten noisy daily announcements. Projects that survive bear markets are usually the ones that stay visible and reliable."

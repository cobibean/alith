        "content": "Project Name\nCheetahHPVQ - An innovative Web3 shopping platform for crypto payments, NFT receipts, and shopper rewards.\nProblem Statement\nOnline shoppers today receive little long-term value from their purchases\u2014receipts are non-functional, rewards are limited and non-transferable, and trust in centralized platforms is often blind. Most e-commerce systems also lack meaningful crypto integration, leaving out users who want borderless, secure, and decentralized payment options. This affects millions of global shoppers and vendors, especially those in regions underserved by traditional financial systems.\nSolution Overview\nCheetahHPVQ is a Web3-powered e-commerce platform that transforms everyday online shopping into a rewarding, transparent, and decentralized experience. Shoppers can pay with cryptocurrencies , and receive NFT receipts that serve as verifiable proof of purchase and stakeable digital assets. These receipts can earn users passive income through platform rewards, turning spending into value creation. Smart contracts ensure trustless, secure transactions, while AI-driven recommendations personalize the shopping journey. By combining blockchain, NFTs, and crypto incentives, CheetahHPVQ reimagines e-commerce with user ownership, financial inclusion, and transparency at its core.\nProject Description\nCheetahHPVQ is a next-generation Web3 e-commerce platform designed to make online shopping more rewarding, secure, and user-owned. At its core, the platform enables users to purchase real-world products\u2014such as electronics, fashion, furniture, and more\u2014using cryptocurrencies . But instead of receiving a traditional digital receipt, users are issued NFT receipts\u2014unique, verifiable digital assets that prove ownership and can be staked on the platform to earn passive income in the form of HPVQ tokens.\nKey features include smart contract-powered escrow payments for buyer protection, AI-driven product recommendations tailored to user behavior, and seamless integration with local and international delivery providers for efficient logistics. Sellers can set up custom storefronts through StoreHPVQ and connect their inventory via API, accepting crypto while maintaining full control over pricing and promotions.\nWe\u2019re exploring technologies like Solidity for smart contracts, IPFS for decentralized data storage, and cross-chain support to accommodate multi-chain crypto payments. The staking mechanism will use a reward pool governed by transparent tokenomics, incentivizing loyalty and repeat purchases.\nWhat excites us most is how CheetahHPVQ flips the e-commerce experience: instead of being a one-way transaction where users spend and lose value, it becomes a system where users earn, own, and participate. It brings real financial inclusion to underserved markets, gives shoppers more control, and introduces a new digital asset class\u2014NFT receipts\u2014as part of everyday commerce. This isn\u2019t just about shopping; it\u2019s about rethinking value in the digital economy.\nCommunity Engagement Features:\nTo onboard users and encourage engagement on CheetahHPVQ, we will implement a gamified experience through a points-based rewards system linked to key platform actions. Here\u2019s the breakdown:\nConnect wallet \u2013 +50 points\nComplete profile setup (name, address, preferences) \u2013 +30 points\nBrowse and add 3+ items to your wishlist/cart \u2013 +20 points\nMake a test purchase using a supported crypto \u2013 +100 points\nMint and view your NFT receipt \u2013 +75 points\nStake NFT receipt for rewards \u2013 +100 points\nUnstake NFT receipt or claim rewards \u2013 +50 points\nTrade or transfer an NFT receipt (testnet) \u2013 +50 points\nRefer a verified new user \u2013 +150 points each\nShare a product or purchase on social media \u2013 +25 points\nJoin the CheetahHPVQ community (Discord/Telegram) \u2013 +20 points\nPoints System & Leaderboard:\nUsers earn XP points for each completed task.\nTop users appear on a public leaderboard and qualify for special airdrops early-access perks, or NFT badges.\nPoints can be converted to HPVQ tokens or redeemed for platform discounts once the mainnet is live.\nHow It Gamifies the Experience:\nBy rewarding users for exploring the platform\u2019s features, we turn onboarding into a challenge-based game. Users are motivated to unlock new tasks, earn rewards, and compete with others, creating a fun and engaging experience.\nImpact on Onboarding:\nThis system reduces learning friction, incentivizes exploration, and creates word-of-mouth growth through referrals. By giving immediate feedback and value for actions, users quickly become familiar with the platform while feeling rewarded every step of the way.\nGetting Involved\nCommunity members can join CheetahHPVQ by connecting their Metis wallets and participating in our early user campaigns to test features and earn rewards. Developers and blockchain enthusiasts are welcome to contribute by helping improve smart contracts, building integrations, or creating new staking .",

                "comment": "Thank you for your great question and your interest in MetaPay!\nLet me answer each part in detail:\n1. Transparent Interface for Recollection Tracking\nMetaPay is designed so that all users can track both the distribution and recollection of funds in real time through their digital wallets.\nAt the end of each month, users will be able to clearly see:\nThe amount recollected (10% of remaining balance)\nThe amount distributed\nCurrent wallet balance\nFull transaction and recollection history\nMonthly reports will also be provided via the mobile app or web-based wallet interface to ensure full transparency.\n2. About Personalizing the Recollection Rate\nMetaPay maintains a fixed 10% recollection rate for all users.\nThis is because the recollected amount is directly used as the fund for the next month\u2019s distribution.\nIf the rate were to vary by individual, it would break the balance of this self-sustaining cycle and threaten the long-term stability of the system.\nHowever, small demographic changes (such as births or deaths) can be handled through government budget adjustments or annual fiscal planning, without affecting the core 10% structure.\nIf you\u2019re curious about the full MetaPay model, please feel free to visit our YouTube channel.\nWe\u2019ve uploaded videos that explain the core mechanics and philosophy of MetaPay in detail:\nMain Intro Video\nMetaPay \u2013 A Circulating Basic Income: Whose Time Are You Living?\nhttps://youtu.be/e4lH_uGN-ck\nVisit Our Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@MetaPayProject\nThank you again for engaging with the project.

                "comment": "Thank you for your thoughtful questions! Let me explain each point clearly.\n1. What happens if a user withdraws all MetaPay before the 10% recollection at the end of the month?\nMetaPay is a closed-loop digital system that cannot be freely withdrawn as cash.\nAll MetaPay balances are managed within your digital wallet and cannot be transferred directly to others or exchanged into fiat currency.\nEven if you attempt to use up all of your balance before the end of the month, the system will calculate the recollection amount based on your wallet balance at that exact time (e.g., 10% of the remaining amount on the last day of the month).\nThis ensures fairness and sustainability, regardless of spending patterns.\n2. How does the automatic 50/50 split payment work between MetaPay and fiat currency?\nWhenever you make a payment at a registered merchant, your wallet automatically splits the transaction:\n50% is paid using MetaPay, and 50% using your existing payment method (cash, credit, etc.).\nThis is enforced by the system and does not require manual input by the user or merchant, maintaining simplicity and compliance.\nIt also ensures MetaPay is circulated and reclaimed properly within the system.\nWant to explore the MetaPay model in detail?\nCheck out the official video and YouTube channel, where we explain the philosophy and mechanism of MetaPay.\nIntro Video\nMetaPay Circulating Basic Income \u2013 \u201cWhose time is it, really?\u201d\n\uba54\ud0c0\ud398\uc774\uc21c\ud658\ud615 \uae30\ubcf8\uc18c\ub4dd : \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc740 \ub204\uad6c\uc758 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\uae4c?\nFull Channel\nYouTube\nMetaPay Project\nShare your videos with friends, family, and the world\nWe believe MetaPay is not just about distributing money\u2014\nit\u2019s about restoring your time, freedom, and dignity.\nLet\u2019s build this future together."

For instance:\nA small EU country with 5 million people could adjust the monthly benefit per person according to national GDP, while keeping the 10% recollection rule intact.\nThis makes MetaPay ideal for pilot testing in:\nSmall EU member states (e.g., Estonia, Slovenia, Portugal)\nDecentralized communities or digital welfare zones\nInternational policy labs with limited fiscal risk\nMetaPay proves that basic income can be self-sustaining, programmable, and globally adaptable\u2014without requiring new taxes.\nLet\u2019s co-create a fairer digital future that begins with circulation, not debt.\nComing next: Technical Architecture & DID-based Identity Integration (Bonus Track)"

Most trading intelligence is centralized, opaque, and inaccessible to non-technical users. As a result, DeFi users frequently miss profitable opportunities or fall prey to volatility, lacking real-time, trustable AI-driven decision support.\nSolution Overview\nHyperMind AI transforms DeFi trading by delivering real-time, AI-generated trading signals directly within a web-based dashboard. Leveraging the Alith AI engine and Hyperion\u2019s AI-native blockchain infrastructure, it offers actionable insights such as BUY, HOLD, MONITOR, or YIELD FARM signals with confidence metrics, risk levels, and expected returns. The system simulates local inference for now, preparing for verifiable on-chain execution. It empowers users of all levels to trade smarter, safer, and faster using intelligence previously only available to professionals.\nProject Description\nHyperMind AI is a real-time DeFi trading assistant that simulates on-chain AI trading intelligence using AlithMock, a local inference engine designed to mirror the behavior of Alith AI. It displays AI signals based on multi-layer neural simulations, tracking entry/exit prices, confidence levels, and risk metrics. Users can interact with a responsive dashboard, execute or monitor trades, and analyze their portfolio in real time.\n\nCore Features:\nAI Signal Feed: Real-time BUY / STRONG BUY / MONITOR / HOLD signals\nConfidence Scores: Up to 98%, updated live\nAlith System Stats: Neural processing speed, win rate, network uptime\nPortfolio Insights: Asset breakdown, daily P&L, Sharpe ratio, AI win rate\nExecution Panel: Run simulated signal execution logic with wallet connection\nEmergency Stop / Auto-Rebalance: Simulated protection features\nTechnologies:\nFrontend: JavaScript + ethers.js\nSmart Contract-ready: Solidity architecture (WIP)\nBackend (simulated): AlithMock inference engine (browser-based)\nChain: Hyperion / Alt-Hyperion Testnet\nUsers can connect a wallet, interact with live signals, monitor returns, and experience AI-assisted DeFi trading with one click. The vision is to shift from static dashboards to truly intelligent DeFi experiences.\nWhat excites us: HyperMind AI is not just a UI\u2014it\u2019s an infrastructure-ready prototype for transparent, AI-native trading systems. As Alith AI matures, this frontend will seamlessly connect to on-chain inference engines, zkML proof generators, and real-time validators.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nTestable Features & Task System:\nConnect Wallet to Hyperion Testnet (+3 pts)\nMonitor Live AI Signals (+5 pts)\nExecute a Signal (Simulated) (+10 pts)\nTrigger Emergency Stop / Auto-Rebalance (+5 pts)\nRate Signal Accuracy After Use (+2 pts)\nPoints System:\nEach action grants points that accumulate in a leaderboard.

Even when you\u2019re actively trying to craft narrative, it\u2019s unavoidable.\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re selling a carrot in the farmer\u2019s market with no booth, no signage, just a basket of carrots and your voice yelling out the price. There\u2019s still an unconscious narrative - it\u2019s fresh, it\u2019s direct from the farm, and it\u2019s a good deal. Then the audience sees the carrot, and can either confirm or reject the premises and make their purchasing decision.\nLike you said, narrative drives attention and product keeps it. Narrative is also inevitable, but product is what\u2019s sought after."

Or is narrative just the native language of a still-immature industry? And how do you balance storytelling with real value?\nCurious to hear how others are thinking about this.\nThis is spot on. In crypto, narrative isn\u2019t just marketing it\u2019s infrastructure. It\u2019s what gets people to care before they even understand the tech.\nReminds me of what Steve Jobs said: \u201cThe most powerful person in the world is the storyteller.\u201d That\u2019s literally crypto in a nutshell. The best protocols don\u2019t just build, they narrate a future people want to believe in.\nOf course, tech has to eventually deliver. But without a story, no one shows up to see it work.

        "content": "As DevEx Lead at Metis, I find myself at one of the most compelling intersections in technology: where AI meets blockchain through verifiable computing. With active blockchain developers declining while AI development explodes, our two-tier SDK strategy; MetisSDK for infrastructure and Alith for verifiable AI applications, represents a sophisticated bet on the future convergence of these technologies.\nThe crypto SDK landscape offers proven patterns for building developer tools that bridge complex technical domains. From Ethers.js achieving mass adoption by abstracting Ethereum complexity to Viem\u2019s performance breakthroughs through modular architecture, successful crypto SDKs demonstrate how to make cutting-edge technology accessible without sacrificing power. For us at Metis, these lessons become even more critical as we\u2019re not just bridging one technical complexity gap, but two: making blockchain accessible to AI developers while introducing an entirely new concept: Verifiable AI.\nThe Verification Imperative: Our Unique Value Proposition\nTraditional crypto SDKs solve for decentralization and consensus; Alith solves for AI trustworthiness in trust-minimized contexts. This distinction fundamentally changes our developer value proposition. While Ethers.js had to convince developers that blockchain was worth learning, we\u2019re addressing a problem AI developers increasingly face but haven\u2019t yet articulated: \u201cHow do I make my AI systems trustworthy enough for decentralized applications?\u201d\nResearch shows that security concerns dominate crypto development cycles, with $2.2 billion stolen from crypto platforms in 2024. For verifiable AI, I believe the stakes are potentially higher, imagine an AI trading bot making decisions based on unverifiable models, or a DeFi protocol relying on AI risk assessments without verification. Our flexible verification options (on-chain inference, TEEs, ZKPs, and off-chain) directly address this through progressive trust models.\nOur approach of letting developers choose the level of verification they want to use mirrors successful crypto SDK patterns where complexity is optional but power is preserved. Alith allows developers to start with familiar AI patterns and gradually adopt verification as they understand its value.\nOnboarding AI Developers: Learning from Cross-Domain SDK Success\nOnboarding friction represents the primary adoption barrier for crypto SDKs. For us, this challenge is amplified: we\u2019re not just onboarding developers to a new SDK, but to an entirely new paradigm of verifiable computation. However, traditional cross-domain SDKs offer proven strategies.\nStripe\u2019s progression model provides a template I find particularly relevant: start with familiar patterns, then introduce advanced concepts as abstraction ladders. For Alith, this means beginning with standard AI workflows (model inference, data processing) in off-chain mode, then demonstrating verification through simple configuration changes. A developer can deploy a recommendation model normally, then see a single line that adds verification without changing their core logic, in addition, our unified SDK approach for rapid feature development makes sense given the bleeding-edge nature of both AI and blockchain.\nArchitectural Lessons for Our Dual-SDK Strategy\nOur two-tier approach: Metis SDK for infrastructure, Alith for applications adds an interesting layer: infrastructure modularity (Metis SDK) supporting application modularity (Alith).\nPerformance and cost optimization through native API usage becomes crucial for our value proposition. Just as Solana Web3.js v2.0 achieved 10x performance improvements, our emphasis on parallelization capabilities and MetisVM optimization directly addresses the performance concerns that could prevent AI developers from adopting verifiable AI.\nJust as dynamic SDKs normalize differences between consensus mechanisms, Alith normalizes differences between verification methods. A developer shouldn\u2019t need to understand the exact implementation details between on-chain verification, TEEs, and ZKPs. Our goal is to make integration of these systems straightforward, with minimal complexity.\nPlugin and extension systems could be particularly powerful for Alith. For AI developers, this means integrating with existing frameworks like ElizaOS, Coinbase\u2019s AgentKit, and Langchain. The goal is for Alith to be interoperable with tools that are used by developers today.\nCommunity Strategy for Our Dual Audiences\nOur approach to community-driven development faces a unique challenge: building community across two distinct developer populations (blockchain + AI) with different mental models, tools, and communication patterns.\nMulti-platform community strategies become essential, but with a twist. AI developers cluster around different platforms than blockchain developers. Our community strategy focuses on merging the benefits of blockchain and AI together to unite developers towards building verifiable AI systems that address the risk and complexity of blockchain-based operation.\nEducational investment proves critical for adoption, and our vision to build a more verifiable world requires significant developer education. Projects that invest in education as core product features achieve better adoption. For us, this means creating resources that help AI developers understand not just how to use verification, but why it matters for their applications. I\u2019m inspired by Solana\u2019s educational approach: they built comprehensive learning resources that match their technical architecture\u2019s philosophy. Our educational content should reinforce our core message that AI and blockchain integration through verification isn\u2019t optional complexity, it\u2019s necessary infrastructure for AI\u2019s integration into financial systems.\nTechnical Architecture for Verification Abstraction\nOur verification abstraction layer represents one of the most sophisticated technical challenges in the SDK space. Successful SDKs excel at hiding complexity while maintaining flexibility. For Alith, this means developers should be able to specify verification requirements declaratively rather than imperatively. Our next step will be to showcase what requires on-chain verification and how to architect applications to fully utilize these verification features.\nEvent-driven architectures from successful crypto SDKs provide patterns for handling verification workflows. AI model inference, proof generation, and on-chain validation all represent asynchronous operations that could benefit from sophisticated event processing. WebSocket connections, message queues, and GraphQL subscriptions provide different approaches to managing blockchain data streams, patterns that can apply directly to verification workflows.\nSecurity-first design patterns become even more critical for verifiable AI. Research shows successful crypto SDKs make security validation default rather than optional. For Alith, this means verification options should be secure by default, with clear escalation paths for developers who need higher assurance levels.\nPerformance monitoring and optimization capabilities could differentiate Alith significantly. Traditional AI frameworks optimize for computational efficiency; Alith should optimize for verification efficiency while maintaining computational performance. This dual optimization challenge requires sophisticated monitoring and adaptive optimization strategies.\nFuture Opportunities: Our Convergence Bet\nOur positioning at the AI-blockchain intersection puts us ahead of trends research identifies as major opportunities. Account Abstraction for AI agents could eliminate the complexity of wallet management for AI systems, making it easier for AI developers to build financially-capable applications.\nAI-powered development assistance represents a natural extension of our platform. Since we\u2019re already building AI infrastructure, we could provide AI-assisted development tools that help developers optimize their verification strategies, suggest appropriate verification levels for different operations, or automatically generate verification configurations.\nIntent-based programming models could be particularly powerful for verifiable AI. Instead of developers manually configuring verification parameters, they could specify intentions like \u201chigh-speed market analysis with moderate verification\u201d or \u201ccritical financial decision with maximum verification,\u201d and Alith could handle the technical implementation.\nSuccess Metrics and Measurement\nGiven our strategy of onboarding AI developers to verifiable systems, traditional crypto SDK metrics need adjustment. Developer adoption matters, but verification adoption rates might be more telling. Are developers starting with off-chain mode and graduating to verification? Are they choosing appropriate verification levels for their use cases?\nCross-pollination metrics could be uniquely valuable: Are AI developers contributing to our blockchain infrastructure? Are blockchain developers building AI applications? Our dual-SDK strategy creates opportunities for knowledge transfer that single-focus SDKs don\u2019t have.\nPerformance benchmarks become critical for credibility with AI developers who are performance-conscious. Demonstrating that verification doesn\u2019t significantly impact inference speed, or that parallelization benefits outweigh verification overhead, provides concrete validation of our architectural choices.\nConclusion: Building the Trust Layer for AI\u2019s Future\nOur work at Metis represents more than SDK development, we\u2019re building the trust infrastructure that will enable AI\u2019s integration into financial systems. Research shows that successful crypto SDKs excel by making complex technology accessible while preserving power for advanced users. For Alith, this means making verification feel like a natural extension of AI development rather than foreign complexity.\nThe convergence we\u2019re betting on: AI requiring trustworthiness, blockchain providing verification, decentralized applications demanding both. This positions Metis to define an entirely new category of developer tools. The lessons from successful crypto SDKs provide a roadmap, but our challenge is more ambitious: not just bridging developers to new technology, but creating the conceptual framework for verifiable AI itself.\nSuccess will likely depend on how effectively we can demonstrate that verification isn\u2019t optional overhead but essential infrastructure. Just as successful crypto SDKs convinced developers that decentralization was worth the complexity, Alith needs to convince AI developers that verification is worth the learning curve. Research suggests this happens through progressive disclosure, excellent documentation, and community investment, all areas where our two-tier strategy provides unique advantages.\nThe future of AI in financial applications will require verification. By building the developer tools that make verification accessible, we\u2019re not just creating SDKs, we\u2019re architecting the trust layer for AI\u2019s next phase of evolution.",

By building the developer tools that make verification accessible, we\u2019re not just creating SDKs, we\u2019re architecting the trust layer for AI\u2019s next phase of evolution."

Thanks again for your interest in our project and for the thoughtful questions. Let me address each of them below\n1) If the dataset is private, how do you ensure Auditors don\u2019t misuse or leak it?\nGreat question. In our current model, auditors must undergo two layers of validation before they\u2019re granted access:\nFirst, they are verified by us (the platform) based on identity and domain expertise.\nSecond, they are validated by the DAO, ensuring community-level accountability.\nWhile trust in auditors is still required to some extent, just like in real-world auditing , we are actively exploring ways to make this process more trustless.\n2) Are Creators allowed to challenge an audit report if they think it\u2019s unfair or inaccurate?\nYes, it\u2019s a crucial safeguard.\nWe agree that auditors shouldn\u2019t have unchecked authority. Creators will have the ability to challenge audit reports, either by:\nRequesting a re-audit (potentially by a different auditor or group of auditors), or\nSubmitting a formal rebuttal that gets appended to the audit report for transparency.\n3) What kinds of use cases are you targeting first \u2013 trading bots, oracles, LLMs?\nOur initial focus is on trading bots and LLMs. These use cases have both high impact and urgent need for trust and verifiability."

Each audit report goes into technical detail, verifying every claim made in the agent\u2019s Claim Manifest \u2014 like the data source, date range, schema, and more.\nAnd yes, confidence naturally increases when multiple auditors review the same dataset. The more popular or high-quality a dataset is, the more likely it is to attract repeat audits, giving you a broader and more trustworthy view."

Here is my reply:\nThe feature like \u201c20-minute video interviews\u201d will start with simple version that will ask some typical questions that is customized for a pair of the position and the candidate before each call.\nThe AI just record the meeting into text, then analyze the answer and give the summary and recommendation. We build AI-driven screening as assistant tool, not a decision tool. Hiring AI Agent will auto some sourcing/screening steps and give summary and recommendation for recruiters, but do have any decision at the final step of screening stage.\nIt aims to spot disqualified talents for minimum requirements, not try to find the best and fit candidates, which still need human intelligence.\nUCTalent focuses on high tech talent, specially in Web3/blockchain and cross-border opportunities, so that English will be the default language for communication.\nThe smart contract can be designed to incorporate a dispute resolution mechanism. In case of disagreements between companies and talents/referrers regarding the referral validity, a dispute fee can be deposited into the smart contract.\nIn the first phase, UCTalent will hold the central decision on dispute resolution process.

                "comment": "Hi\n@priyankg3\nHope you doing great and thank for the great question. Here are my feedback for 2 questions:\n1. Value of Blockchain-Based Hiring for Web2 Companies (Beyond Crypto Hesitation):\nFor Web2 companies, the primary value of UCTalent\u2019s blockchain-based hiring lies in building immediate trust, verifiable transparency, and efficiency in the recruitment process, regardless of whether the final reward is paid in crypto or fiat.\nTrust and Transparency in Referrals: Blockchain creates an immutable, tamper-proof record of every referral, its terms, and the hiring outcome. This means:\nReduced Risk: Companies have full transparency on the referral flow and reward conditions, eliminating common trust issues with traditional agencies or unknown headhunters.\nVerifiable Outcomes: Every step is recorded, ensuring fairness and accountability.\nNo Upfront Commitment: Our \u201cPay If You Hire Someone\u201d cash reward model, backed by blockchain\u2019s verifiable process, allows companies to incentivize a vast network of \u201cfreelancer headhunters\u201d and external talent without any upfront payment or traditional contract complexities. This fosters trust and enables powerful crowdsourced recruitment.\nExpanded Talent Pool & Quality: By creating a trusted, incentivized system, companies can tap into a wider, often passive, network of top talent that might not be reached through traditional job boards. High-quality talent is more likely to engage when they trust the reward mechanism and the fairness of the process.\nEfficiency & Cost Savings: The automation inherent in smart contracts for reward distribution (upon successful hire) reduces administrative overhead and disputes, leading to faster, more streamlined hiring and ultimately, significant cost savings compared to traditional headhunting fees.\nIn essence, blockchain acts as a powerful trust and verification layer, creating a more reliable and efficient recruitment ecosystem that benefits all parties.\n2. Payment Flexibility: Fiat-Onboarding for Employers:\nYou\u2019re absolutely right to ask about payment flexibility! Recruiters will not be forced to pay or reward in crypto.\nFlexible Reward Options: UCTalent offers both crypto and fiat-based reward options to cater to diverse company needs:\n\u201cDeposit Crypto Reward (Money Safe Until Hire)\u201d: For crypto-native companies, they can deposit crypto directly into our smart contracts, held securely until a successful hire.\n\u201cSet Up Cash Reward (Pay If You Hire Someone)\u201d: For Web2 companies or those preferring traditional payments, they can opt for cash rewards, with payment only triggered upon successful hire. This is designed for maximum ease of adoption.\nStrategic Phased Approach:\nEarly Phase Focus: In our early phase, we are indeed focusing on Web3/blockchain companies and projects that are already familiar with and comfortable using crypto, as this allows for seamless integration with our core blockchain features from day one.\nFuture Fiat On-Ramp: As we grow and expand our user base, we will absolutely offer robust fiat-onboarding and off-ramping solutions for employers. Our goal is to make the platform accessible and user-friendly for all companies, regardless of their crypto familiarity. This ensures broad adoption and aligns with our mission to revolutionize recruitment for the entire industry.\nWe believe this flexible approach allows UCTalent to deliver immediate value to the Web3 ecosystem while strategically paving the way for broader adoption by Web2 companies."

                "comment": "Update for our proposal to focus more on Freelance headhunter as referrer, not just normal talents as they are more motivated to do referral forliving.\nRevised UCTalent Application for HyperHack\nProject Name UCTalent: AI-Powered Talent Network on Hyperion\nProblem Statement Web3 recruitment is inefficient, fragmented, and prohibitively expensive. Centralized headhunters charge massive fees (15%\u201345%), creating slow (6\u201310 weeks) hiring cycles that hinder ecosystem growth. There is a major disconnect between global companies and deep talent pools, especially in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, there is no efficient, on-chain marketplace for Web3 freelancers to offer services and get paid, nor a way for freelance headhunters to effectively monetize their networks.\nSolution Overview UCTalent is an AI-powered talent network built on Hyperion to decentralize and accelerate recruitment. We leverage the Alith AI Agent framework and Hyperion\u2019s high-throughput infrastructure to create a transparent, low-cost, and efficient ecosystem for hiring, freelancing, and decentralized headhunting.\nDecentralized Headhunting on Hyperion: Companies post on-chain referral rewards on Hyperion smart contracts. Any freelance headhunter can refer talent and earn the reward upon a successful hire, creating a transparent, permissionless recruitment model.\nOn-Chain Freelancer Marketplace: A dedicated marketplace where Web3 professionals can offer services (e.g., smart contract audits, UI design) and get paid instantly in crypto via Hyperion\u2019s fast, low-cost transactions.\nAI Agents Powered by Alith: Our dual Alith AI Agents\u2014Career and Hiring\u2014use secure, on-chain AI to automate job matching, CV screening, and interviews, dramatically increasing the speed and efficiency of the entire hiring process.\nProject Description UCTalent is building the future of Web3 talent acquisition on Hyperion with these core features:\nDecentralized Headhunting: The core of our platform. Companies lock a referral reward into a Hyperion smart contract. This incentivizes a global network of freelance headhunters to source and refer top candidates. The smart contract, running on Hyperion\u2019s scalable infrastructure, guarantees instant and transparent payment to the successful headhunter upon hire.\nFreelancer Marketplace: To drive immediate economic activity, UCTalent features a dedicated marketplace. Web3 talent can list their services and find short-term projects. All transactions are settled on-chain via Hyperion, ensuring fast, reliable, and low-cost crypto payments for completed work.\nHiring/Talent AI Agent Framework: Our competitive edge lies in our dual AI agents, built using the Alith AI Agent framework for secure and scalable AI operations on-chain.\nHiring AI Agent: Helps companies generate optimized job posts and provides freelance headhunters with powerful tools to screen candidates. It leverages Alith AI to conduct automated initial interviews, summarizing qualifications for rapid review.\nCareer AI Agent: Empowers talent and freelancers to build dynamic profiles and receive intelligent job or project recommendations based on their skills and on-chain activity.\nBuilt for Hyperion: The entire platform leverages Hyperion\u2019s MetisVM for parallel execution, ensuring our application is fast, responsive, and can scale to handle a high volume of transactions for referrals, payments, and AI-driven actions. KYC integration ensures a high-quality, spam-free network.\nCommunity Engagement Features UCTalent gamifies participation, leveraging Hyperion to build a vibrant community of talent, freelancers, and headhunters.\nTasks:\nCreate a talent, freelancer, or headhunter profile (with KYC): 1,000 points.\nList a service on the Freelancer Marketplace: 500 points.\nRefer a verified candidate who gets an interview: 2,000 points.\nTest the Alith AI job matching and interview features: 300 points/task.\nSubmit UX/bug feedback on the Hyperion testnet deployment: 200 points/submission.\nPoints System: Pioneer Program points convert to UCTalent Tokens (1:1, capped 100,000/year), used for premium features like promoting a freelance service or boosting a candidate\u2019s profile.\nGamification: Leaderboards will track the most successful freelance headhunters and top-earning freelancers, creating a competitive and rewarding environment powered by on-chain activity on Hyperion.\nGetting Involved Join UCTalent\u2019s HyperHack journey:\nFreelancers & Headhunters: Create your profile, list a service on our marketplace, and test the referral system on Hyperion\u2019s testnet.\nDevelopers: Help us build the future of recruitment. Contribute to our Solidity contracts and Alith AI integrations via our Discord and the Metis Forum.\nFeedback: Stress-test our entire platform, from the marketplace to the AI tools, from July 15\u2013August 7 and earn rewards for your feedback.\nCompanies: Test our AI-powered hiring tools to see how you can accelerate hiring and reduce costs on the Hyperion network."

        "content": "I\u2019ve been wrestling with this question as we scale our operations and bring on more contributors.\nShould we track how many hours people work, or just focus on what they deliver?\nMost traditional companies are obsessed with time tracking. Clock in at 9, clock out at 5. Track every minute. Measure productivity by hours logged. But in web3, we\u2019re supposedly building the future of work, right?\nThe time-tracking side\nThere\u2019s something to be said for time tracking. It creates accountability. People show up. You know who\u2019s pulling their weight and who\u2019s coasting. It\u2019s fair in the sense that everyone puts in the same effort.\nPlus, let\u2019s be honest, some tasks genuinely require time investment. You can\u2019t rush good research. You can\u2019t shortcut relationship building. Community management isn\u2019t about quick wins, it\u2019s about consistent presence.\nAnd there\u2019s the practical side. How do you budget for projects if you don\u2019t know how long things take? How do you plan resources or set realistic expectations?\nThe output-based argument\nBut then I think about the best contributors I know. They don\u2019t work normal hours. They work in bursts. They might solve a week\u2019s worth of problems in a single afternoon, then spend three days thinking.\nSome people are naturally faster. Some have better tools, more experience, or just think differently. Why should someone who can deliver the same result in 2 hours get paid less than someone who takes 8?\nAnd honestly, time tracking feels like we don\u2019t trust people. Like we\u2019re managing children instead of partners in building something meaningful.\nThe web3 complexity\nIn traditional companies, you can maybe get away with time tracking because the work is predictable. But web3 moves too fast. The priorities change weekly. The opportunities come and go in days.\nHow do you time-track \u201cfigured out why our community engagement dropped 30%\u201d or \u201cidentified the next big narrative we should position for\u201d? The value isn\u2019t in the hours spent, it\u2019s in the insight gained.\nAnd here\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with right now: we need methodologies like Agile to stay organized across time zones and different initiatives, but these frameworks can feel rigid and creativity-killing. For distributed teams, accountability is crucial, but so is keeping work engaging and satisfying. Nobody wants their passion project to feel like tedious corporate \u201cwork.\u201d\nThe tricky part? While any framework is better than no framework, it\u2019s nearly impossible to teach methodology when there\u2019s no motivation to learn. The pain needs to become unbearable for people to have that \u201cgotcha\u201d moment and understand why structured approaches actually help rather than hinder.\nThe moment work becomes boring repetition, you lose the creative spark that makes web3 special. But without some structure, distributed teams fall apart.\nMy current thinking\nI\u2019m leaning toward output-based management, but with some guardrails. Clear deliverables, regular check-ins, transparent communication about what you\u2019re working on and why.\nBut I\u2019m worried about a few things:\nHow do you handle tasks that are important but hard to measure? Like \u201cbuilding relationships\u201d or \u201cstaying on top of industry trends\u201d?\nWhat about people who game the system?

                "comment": "I\u2019ve been wrestling with this question as we scale our operations and bring on more contributors.\nShould we track how many hours people work, or just focus on what they deliver?\nMost traditional companies are obsessed with time tracking. Clock in at 9, clock out at 5. Track every minute. Measure productivity by hours logged. But in web3, we\u2019re supposedly building the future of work, right?\nThe time-tracking side\nThere\u2019s something to be said for time tracking. It creates accountability. People show up. You know who\u2019s pulling their weight and who\u2019s coasting. It\u2019s fair in the sense that everyone puts in the same effort.\nPlus, let\u2019s be honest, some tasks genuinely require time investment. You can\u2019t rush good research. You can\u2019t shortcut relationship building. Community management isn\u2019t about quick wins, it\u2019s about consistent presence.\nAnd there\u2019s the practical side. How do you budget for projects if you don\u2019t know how long things take? How do you plan resources or set realistic expectations?\nThe output-based argument\nBut then I think about the best contributors I know. They don\u2019t work normal hours. They work in bursts. They might solve a week\u2019s worth of problems in a single afternoon, then spend three days thinking.\nSome people are naturally faster. Some have better tools, more experience, or just think differently. Why should someone who can deliver the same result in 2 hours get paid less than someone who takes 8?\nAnd honestly, time tracking feels like we don\u2019t trust people. Like we\u2019re managing children instead of partners in building something meaningful.\nThe web3 complexity\nIn traditional companies, you can maybe get away with time tracking because the work is predictable. But web3 moves too fast. The priorities change weekly. The opportunities come and go in days.\nHow do you time-track \u201cfigured out why our community engagement dropped 30%\u201d or \u201cidentified the next big narrative we should position for\u201d? The value isn\u2019t in the hours spent, it\u2019s in the insight gained.\nAnd here\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with right now: we need methodologies like Agile to stay organized across time zones and different initiatives, but these frameworks can feel rigid and creativity-killing. For distributed teams, accountability is crucial, but so is keeping work engaging and satisfying. Nobody wants their passion project to feel like tedious corporate \u201cwork.\u201d\nThe tricky part? While any framework is better than no framework, it\u2019s nearly impossible to teach methodology when there\u2019s no motivation to learn. The pain needs to become unbearable for people to have that \u201cgotcha\u201d moment and understand why structured approaches actually help rather than hinder.\nThe moment work becomes boring repetition, you lose the creative spark that makes web3 special. But without some structure, distributed teams fall apart.\nMy current thinking\nI\u2019m leaning toward output-based management, but with some guardrails. Clear deliverables, regular check-ins, transparent communication about what you\u2019re working on and why.\nBut I\u2019m worried about a few things:\nHow do you handle tasks that are important but hard to measure? Like \u201cbuilding relationships\u201d or \u201cstaying on top of industry trends\u201d?\nWhat about people who game the system?

                "comment": "I\u2019ve noticed some habits that separate consistent builders from the rest:\nStart before you feel ready\nThe best builders don\u2019t wait for the perfect setup or the perfect moment. They begin, even if it feels messy.\nAsk questions early\nStrong builders don\u2019t waste weeks pretending to know everything. They ask, even if it feels obvious.\nKeep a builder\u2019s journal\nWriting down ideas, lessons, and mistakes makes it easier to spot patterns over time.\nFind a builder buddy\nHaving someone to share progress with, swap feedback, or even just check in helps keep the momentum going.\nCelebrate progress, not perfection\nEvery small step matters. Progress compounds much faster than waiting for a flawless release.\nCurious what habits have kept you going when motivation dips or things get tough."

It\u2019s hard not just to use the platform, but also to understand how perp trading works and choose a strategy.\nDogex solves this with an AI-powered, user-friendly platform on Hyperion \u2014 featuring a smart assistant, autotrading and simple tools for beginners.\nDogex\u2019s mission\nDogex is not just another perp exchange. It\u2019s the gateway to DeFi for the next generation of traders.\nDogex NOW:\nSimplicity\nA clean, minimal interface focused on what matters: quick position entry and exit, clear margin information, real-time updates. Fully mobile-compatible and beginner-friendly.\nSpeed and Scalability\nHyperion\u2019s parallel transaction architecture ensures ultra-low latency and near-instant order execution. It delivers a user experience comparable to centralized exchanges while remaining fully decentralized.\nHigh Leverage and 1-Minute Charts\nDogex offers high leverage and access to 1-minute timeframes.

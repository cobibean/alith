        "content": "Problem Statement\nIn bull markets, crypto asset holders often miss significant opportunities for active trading profits by focusing solely on passive yield strategies. Manual trading is emotionally taxing, requires constant market monitoring, and demands technical analysis skills many users lack. Additionally, traders struggle to maintain consistent strategies, often shifting approaches based on emotion rather than data, leading to suboptimal results.\nSolution Overview\nLazaiTrader is an intelligent multi-agent trading system accessible through Telegram that allows users to select specialized AI trading personas, each with distinct strategies and risk profiles. The system continuously analyzes market conditions and either generates actionable buy/sell signals or automatically executes trades across major DEXs based on user preference. Built on the same robust Alith framework infrastructure, LazaiTrader adapts to market conditions while maintaining the user\u2019s selected trading philosophy, effectively bringing institutional-grade trading strategies to retail users through a familiar messaging interface.\nProject Description\nLazaiTrader transforms crypto trading by allowing users to select from various AI trading personas, each representing different trading philosophies and strategies. Whether you prefer momentum trading, swing trading, technical analysis, or contrarian approaches, LazaiTrader provides a suite of specialized AI agents to match your preferred style.\nCore features include the \u201cPersona Selection\u201d system allowing users to choose trading philosophies that match their temperament, \u201cStrategy Visualization\u201d showing potential entry/exit points before execution, and \u201cDual-Mode Operation\u201d offering either signal-only notifications or fully automated trade execution. The system leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) technology and the Alith framework to maintain coherent understanding across interactions, remembering user preferences, portfolio composition, and past decisions.\nThe platform is designed to integrate with major DEXs like Uniswap v3 and can adapt to available liquidity sources. Our algorithms move beyond traditional indicators like moving averages which might not be as reliable in volatile crypto markets. Instead, we use momentum-based strategies that capitalize on emerging trends before they become obvious, volatility-adaptive approaches that dynamically adjust position sizes based on market conditions, and liquidity flow analysis to identify smart money movements before price reacts.\nUsers can select specific asset-focused strategies including Blue Chip Trader (focusing on BTC, ETH, METIS and other established cryptocurrencies) or Micro Cap Trader for those seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in emerging tokens. Each persona combines these strategy elements differently based on their trading philosophy.\nUsers interact with the system through a natural, conversational interface that explains complex trading strategies in accessible terms tailored to each user\u2019s demonstrated technical understanding. What makes LazaiTrader particularly valuable is its recognition that bull markets favor active trading strategies rather than passive yield farming approaches, allowing users to capitalize on market momentum through their preferred trading style. The system even suggests transitioning to yield strategies when market indicators suggest bearish conditions ahead, providing a complete crypto asset management solution.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nPersona Selection (50 points): Users select their first trading persona and complete the initial risk assessment. No wallet connection required at this stage.\nFirst Trading Signal (100 points): Users receive their first trading signal through the platform. All signals are recorded server-side for performance tracking even without wallet connection.\nWallet Connection (75 points): Users connect their wallet for additional features and functionality.\nRisk Adjustment (50 points): Users modify their risk parameters and observe how their trading persona adapts.\nReferral Program (25 points per referral): Users earn points by inviting others, with bonus points when referred users complete their first trade.\nTrading Performance Achievements (variable points): Users unlock badges and points when their strategies reach specific ROI thresholds.\nThis gamification approach creates clear milestones for users while educating them about different trading methodologies. The points system rewards actions that benefit both the user and the platform ecosystem.\nGetting Involved\nInterested community members can join our project by:\nJoining our Telegram channel at Telegram: View @gmetisio\nFollowing our development updates on Twitter/X @gMetisL2 /\n@smartonstuff\nContributing to our open-source components on Gmetisl2 (gMetis) \u00b7 GitHub\nAnd SmartOnStuff (Mart) \u00b7 GitHub\nParticipating in our upcoming beta testing program by signing up at LazaiTrader.gmetis.io (website launching later)\nReaching out directly to our team via dev@gmetis.io for partnership opportunities or technical collaboration\nJoining our open dev sessions (dates to be announced) where we\u2019ll troubleshoot implementation challenges together",

If you prefer to stay in position for 5-10 or even 20% swings, there are agents that agree with you.\nOwn your strategy - no compromises."

Direct Feedback = Product Gold\nHosting a casual AMA or open mic community call lets your users tell you exactly what they want\u2014without filling out a form or jumping through hoops. You\u2019ll hear pain points, feature requests, and even new use cases you never thought of. It\u2019s like live UX research, but faster and free.\n2. Stronger Community = Higher Retention\nPeople don\u2019t stick around just for good products\u2014they stay because they feel seen. Regular Spaces or calls build emotional connection. When users hear your voice or get their question answered live, it deepens loyalty. And loyal users are the best advocates.\n3. Thought Leadership = Organic Reach\nYou don\u2019t need to go viral. Just be consistent. Twitter Spaces and public AMAs give you a stage to share insights, not just updates. Over time, you become known as someone who shows up and knows what they\u2019re talking about. That builds authority\u2014and people start sharing your content organically.\n4. Collabs Happen in Real Time\nI\u2019ve seen unexpected partnerships form just because someone joined a community call or co-hosted a Space. These moments don\u2019t happen in emails or cold DMs\u2014they happen in public conversations where there\u2019s a shared vibe and momentum.\nSo what\u2019s the actual ROI?\nIf you\u2019re measuring success only in clicks or conversions, these formats might look soft. But if you\u2019re playing the long game\u2014building relationships, brand depth, and user insight\u2014they\u2019re a goldmine.\nMy tip: don\u2019t treat these calls as side content.

Let\u2019s break down the psychology behind it.\nWhy Community Hits Different in Token-Based Projects\n1. We all want to belong.\nJoining a token community often feels like joining a club. You get the inside jokes, the memes, the shared mission. Holding the token isn\u2019t just about potential gains\u2014it\u2019s about being part of something.\n2.

No one wants to miss out on the next big thing.\n3. Tokens = tiny pieces of ownership.\nEven if it\u2019s just a few dollars, holding a project\u2019s token makes people feel involved.

Got airdropped for helping out? That stuff feels good. It\u2019s human nature\u2014we like feeling seen and rewarded, and tokens give projects fun ways to do that.\n5. FOMO is real.\nA big part of Web3 marketing is timing. If everyone\u2019s talking about a new token or campaign, it creates urgency. It\u2019s not just about gains\u2014it\u2019s about not wanting to be the only one left out.\nSo\u2026 Why Should You Care?\nIf you\u2019re working on a token project, it\u2019s not just about building a product\u2014it\u2019s about building a vibe. One that makes people feel welcome, involved, and excited to show up every day.\nSome questions to think about:\nWhat makes you feel connected to a project?\nHave you ever joined a community just for the token\u2014and stayed for the people?\nWhat kind of rewards or experiences made you feel appreciated?\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

Got airdropped for helping out? That stuff feels good. It\u2019s human nature\u2014we like feeling seen and rewarded, and tokens give projects fun ways to do that.\n5. FOMO is real.\nA big part of Web3 marketing is timing. If everyone\u2019s talking about a new token or campaign, it creates urgency. It\u2019s not just about gains\u2014it\u2019s about not wanting to be the only one left out.\nSo\u2026 Why Should You Care?\nIf you\u2019re working on a token project, it\u2019s not just about building a product\u2014it\u2019s about building a vibe. One that makes people feel welcome, involved, and excited to show up every day.\nSome questions to think about:\nWhat makes you feel connected to a project?\nHave you ever joined a community just for the token\u2014and stayed for the people?\nWhat kind of rewards or experiences made you feel appreciated?\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

                "comment": "Thank you for your great question and your interest in MetaPay!\nLet me answer each part in detail:\n1. Transparent Interface for Recollection Tracking\nMetaPay is designed so that all users can track both the distribution and recollection of funds in real time through their digital wallets.\nAt the end of each month, users will be able to clearly see:\nThe amount recollected (10% of remaining balance)\nThe amount distributed\nCurrent wallet balance\nFull transaction and recollection history\nMonthly reports will also be provided via the mobile app or web-based wallet interface to ensure full transparency.\n2. About Personalizing the Recollection Rate\nMetaPay maintains a fixed 10% recollection rate for all users.\nThis is because the recollected amount is directly used as the fund for the next month\u2019s distribution.\nIf the rate were to vary by individual, it would break the balance of this self-sustaining cycle and threaten the long-term stability of the system.\nHowever, small demographic changes (such as births or deaths) can be handled through government budget adjustments or annual fiscal planning, without affecting the core 10% structure.\nIf you\u2019re curious about the full MetaPay model, please feel free to visit our YouTube channel.\nWe\u2019ve uploaded videos that explain the core mechanics and philosophy of MetaPay in detail:\nMain Intro Video\nMetaPay \u2013 A Circulating Basic Income: Whose Time Are You Living?\nhttps://youtu.be/e4lH_uGN-ck\nVisit Our Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@MetaPayProject\nThank you again for engaging with the project.

                "comment": "Thank you for your thoughtful questions! Let me explain each point clearly.\n1. What happens if a user withdraws all MetaPay before the 10% recollection at the end of the month?\nMetaPay is a closed-loop digital system that cannot be freely withdrawn as cash.\nAll MetaPay balances are managed within your digital wallet and cannot be transferred directly to others or exchanged into fiat currency.\nEven if you attempt to use up all of your balance before the end of the month, the system will calculate the recollection amount based on your wallet balance at that exact time (e.g., 10% of the remaining amount on the last day of the month).\nThis ensures fairness and sustainability, regardless of spending patterns.\n2. How does the automatic 50/50 split payment work between MetaPay and fiat currency?\nWhenever you make a payment at a registered merchant, your wallet automatically splits the transaction:\n50% is paid using MetaPay, and 50% using your existing payment method (cash, credit, etc.).\nThis is enforced by the system and does not require manual input by the user or merchant, maintaining simplicity and compliance.\nIt also ensures MetaPay is circulated and reclaimed properly within the system.\nWant to explore the MetaPay model in detail?\nCheck out the official video and YouTube channel, where we explain the philosophy and mechanism of MetaPay.\nIntro Video\nMetaPay Circulating Basic Income \u2013 \u201cWhose time is it, really?\u201d\n\uba54\ud0c0\ud398\uc774\uc21c\ud658\ud615 \uae30\ubcf8\uc18c\ub4dd : \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc740 \ub204\uad6c\uc758 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\uae4c?\nFull Channel\nYouTube\nMetaPay Project\nShare your videos with friends, family, and the world\nWe believe MetaPay is not just about distributing money\u2014\nit\u2019s about restoring your time, freedom, and dignity.\nLet\u2019s build this future together."

                "comment": "MetaPay Circulation Structure Visualization (Updated)\nMetaPay is not just about distribution\u2014it is a self-sustaining, circular basic income model that continuously operates through automatic recollection and redistribution using digital currency.\nWithout any need for long-term tax increases or additional government spending, the initial KRW 250 trillion investment enters an infinite loop of monthly distribution and recollection\u2014creating a durable, automated system.\nThe chart below visualizes how the MetaPay system operates over time:\nInitial Capital: KRW 250 trillion (distributed over 10 months at KRW 25 trillion per month)\nImportantly, this initial capital is not a sunk cost.\nAs basic income boosts consumption and economic activity, increased tax revenue can be used to repay the original KRW 250 trillion\u2014without cutting existing programs or raising new taxes.\nRecollection Start: From month 10.5 onward, 10% of each wallet\u2019s remaining balance is automatically recollected at the end of every month\nRecollected Funds: Fully reused as the source of next month\u2019s distribution\nResult: A perfectly circular economic loop with zero net fiscal burden\n\u201cThis model can be piloted in small EU nations by adjusting the distribution-to-recollection ratio to fit local GDP.\u201d\nChart Breakdown\nGreen Bars (Distribution): KRW 25 trillion distributed each month\nRed Bars (Recollection): KRW 25 trillion recollected monthly starting at month 10.5\nBlue Line (Cumulative Balance): Tracks the total circulating balance\n\u2192 It rises for the first 10 months, then stabilizes at KRW 250 trillion\n\u2192 This equilibrium is maintained as long as distribution and recollection stay synchronized.\nGlobal Applicability & Pilot Readiness\nMetaPay is designed with a simple mathematical formula that is independent of any specific country\u2019s tax laws or welfare system:\nDistribution (B) = Fixed amount (e.g. 25T)\nRecollection (R) = 10% of wallet balance at the end of the month\nIf B = R \u2192 The system becomes self-sustaining\nBecause of this, MetaPay can be implemented anywhere by adjusting only the base amount according to local GDP or population. For instance:\nA small EU country with 5 million people could adjust the monthly benefit per person according to national GDP, while keeping the 10% recollection rule intact.\nThis makes MetaPay ideal for pilot testing in:\nSmall EU member states (e.g., Estonia, Slovenia, Portugal)\nDecentralized communities or digital welfare zones\nInternational policy labs with limited fiscal risk\nMetaPay proves that basic income can be self-sustaining, programmable, and globally adaptable\u2014without requiring new taxes.\nLet\u2019s co-create a fairer digital future that begins with circulation, not debt.\nComing next: Technical Architecture & DID-based Identity Integration (Bonus Track)"

Project Summary\nProject Name: MetaPay\nDomain: Web3, Digital Currency, Public Policy, Universal Basic Income, Privacy (ZK-ID)\nMetaPay is a programmable, circulating basic income system that enables sustainable redistribution without raising taxes. It operates entirely through digital currency and blockchain infrastructure, ensuring economic inclusion and policy transparency. Importantly, MetaPay is designed to work alongside existing welfare programs\u2014supporting, not replacing, traditional social protections.\n2. Technical Structure & Flow\nCore Mechanism:\nAn initial capital of 250 trillion KRW is distributed over 10 months (25 trillion/month) via Web3 wallets. From month 11, 10% of each wallet\u2019s remaining balance is automatically recollected and reused for the next cycle\u2014forming an infinite redistribution loop that requires no additional taxes or external funding.\nDistribution Cycle:\nEach citizen receives 500,000 KRW per month in MetaPay\nPayments are made through digital wallets\nAll purchases are auto-split: 50% MetaPay + 50% fiat (cash, card, etc.)\nPayment patterns are transparently trackable, no manual input needed\nRecollection Cycle:\nAt the end of each month (starting month 11), 10% of leftover wallet balance is recollected\nThese funds become the source of the next month\u2019s universal distribution\nNo penalties or restrictions\u2014recollection applies only to unused MetaPay\nZK-ID Integration: To ensure fairness and prevent abuse:\nFacial recognition via Alice biometric layer during onboarding\nDID (Decentralized ID) and VC (Verifiable Credential) issued per person\nSmart contracts verify uniqueness (1 wallet per person) without revealing private data\n3. Policy Relevance & Feasibility\nSubmitted to South Korea\u2019s national digital democracy platform\nPolitically safe: No interference with welfare or pension systems\nTechnically versatile: Works with national ID infrastructure or ZK-ID-only regions\nFinancially circular: System sustains itself without future tax increases\n4. Public Engagement & Tools\nTestnet-based simulator (distribute \u2192 recollect \u2192 redistribute)\nYouTube explainer: \u201cWhose Time Are You Living?\u201d\nAll smart contracts are open-source and modular (on GitHub)\nSystem interoperable with Polygon ID, Semaphore, Worldcoin ZK stack\n5. Technical Stack\nSmart Contracts: Solidity (ERC20 logic, programmable recollection)\nWallet: MetaMask, Hyperion Wallet (custom UI with auto-split logic)\nIdentity: Biometric face scan + DID + VC (ZK-proof)\nLedger: Optional off-chain ledger for institutional use\nFrontend: React, Web3.js\nSimulation: Vercel-hosted interactive DApp\nMetaPay is more than a prototype. It\u2019s a scalable blueprint for fair, transparent, and programmable digital basic income."

Please let me know if that could be arranged\nThe video demo and DApp can be shared upon request. Feedback and collaboration welcome!"

After weeks of development, we\u2019re finally approaching the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for.\nThe IYield MVP is almost ready \u2014 and very soon, we\u2019ll be sharing live demo links so anyone can test our first public release.\nIf you\u2019re reading this, thank you for your patience and support. The wait is nearly over.\nStay tuned."

                "comment": "It\u2019s a powerful idea, no doubtbut we need to interrogate it before rushing to build.\nYes, DATs promise usage-based revenue and ownership, but there are some non-trivial challenges baked into this vision:\nQuality Control vs. Open Contribution\nIf anyone can contribute data and expect compensation, what safeguards exist to prevent low-quality, adversarial, or even toxic datasets from flooding the network? Decentralized doesn\u2019t mean unfiltered.\nAttribution is a Nightmare\nHow do we accurately track which datasets directly influenced a model\u2019s output especially in multi-source training scenarios? Without granular attribution, revenue-sharing quickly becomes speculative or unfair.\nGaming the System\nTokenized rewards always open the door to manipulation. Think botnets uploading synthetic data or feedback loops designed solely to trigger payout thresholds. This needs aggressive prevention design.\nLegal & Ethical Landmines\nIf a user uploads copyrighted or sensitive data, who\u2019s liable? The protocol? The contributors? The downstream AI project? Decentralization doesn\u2019t erase legal responsibility.\nRevenue Distribution Models Are Still Vague\nHow exactly will revenue be split between thousands of contributors? Based on access? Utility? Frequency of use? These formulas will need to be not only transparent but also defensible under scrutiny.h\nSo yes DATs might offer a new design space, but turning them into a reliable, abuse-resistant, and value-aligned mechanism for AI is far from solved.\nBuilders should proceed but with eyes wide open."

        "content": "Introduction\nThe first edition of the Metis Telegram Text AMA launched with a focus on the Hyperion Forum and the ongoing Guilds Campaign. Hosted by Norbert from the Metis community team, the session welcomed Daryl, a member of the Metis Governance group, who unpacked the design, incentives, and future direction of the Forum and Guilds structure.\nHere\u2019s a full recap of the session in chat-style format.\nAMA Transcript\nNorbert: What is the Hyperion Forum and how is it different from other blockchain communities? Who is it designed for?\nDaryl: The Hyperion Forum is a collaborative space for all contributors\u2014builders, marketers, and operators\u2014to work together on dApps within the Metis ecosystem. Unlike many blockchain communities that cater mainly to devs, the Forum offers structured Guilds to support all roles involved in launching successful projects. It\u2019s built on Discourse and includes gamified features like badges and a points system. It\u2019s also the home for HyperHack, our $200K hackathon.\nNorbert: How do Guilds work inside the Forum? Can someone join more than one?\nDaryl: Guilds are like subreddits within the Forum\u2014dedicated spaces for Builders, Marketers, and Operators. Anyone can view content, but to post or comment, you\u2019ll need to officially join a Guild. To do so, click \u201cjoin here\u201d in the Guilds section, answer a short form, and you\u2019ll be approved within 24\u201348 hours. You\u2019re free to join multiple Guilds, especially if you wear many hats like a founder.\nNorbert: Tell us about the points and reputation system. How does it work and what do contributors get out of it?\nDaryl: Every meaningful action\u2014posting, replying, helping others, inviting members, etc.\u2014earns you points and badges. These are tracked publicly on the leaderboard. Over time, we\u2019ll introduce onchain benefits tied to these contributions. You can learn more in the Badge and Point System Guide on the forum.\nNorbert: What\u2019s the purpose behind the Guilds Campaign? Why are Guilds so important to the long-term vision?\nDaryl: The goal is to create specialized, high-signal communities where project teams can find support, share challenges, and scale together. The Forum becomes a place where teams can get actual help\u2014like figuring out user needs, audit readiness, or getting testers\u2014directly from peers in the ecosystem.\nNorbert: What does it take to become a Guild Leader? What kind of activity or traits are you looking for?\nDaryl: To qualify, you need a few key badges:\nMember (TL2)\nCampaigner (invited 3 members)\nAppreciated (received 1 like on 20 posts)\nCertified and Licensed (advanced forum knowledge) These metrics prove someone is active, helpful, and understands how to guide others.\nNorbert: What are the rewards for Guild Leaders, both now and in the future?\nDaryl: Immediate rewards include special titles, wallet perks like zero gas, and exclusive badges. Long-term, Guild Leaders could receive METIS token incentives, expanded governance roles, early access to new features, and scaled rewards based on their Guild\u2019s performance.\nNorbert: What responsibilities will Guild Leaders have?\nDaryl: Guild Leaders manage membership, moderate posts, set permissions, and guide their communities. Think of it as collaborative leadership, not admin control. You\u2019re there to help your Guild thrive\u2014not just enforce rules.\nNorbert: Are there long-term incentives tied to leadership performance?\nDaryl: Yes\u2014though we\u2019re not disclosing everything just yet. There\u2019s a real budget set aside, and Guild Leaders who scale their communities meaningfully will be rewarded even more.\nNorbert: Can people create new Guilds beyond the current three?\nDaryl: Not at this stage. We\u2019re focusing on growing the three core Guilds to build critical mass. New Guilds could emerge later once engagement is high enough. We want to avoid early fragmentation.\nCommunity Q&A\nBrownhawks_Degen: Is the Guild initiative open to everyone? What stops users from spamming the system?\nDaryl: Yes, anyone can join Guilds. We use Discourse, which has powerful built-in moderation and spam detection tools. We\u2019ve also enabled AI-assisted moderation for added security.\nDo\u011fukan: What real-world challenges are being used to validate AI-native dApps, and how is success measured?\nDaryl: This is a great topic for the Builders Guild. Feel free to post it there to spark a deeper discussion.\n\u041d\u0430\u0444\u0430\u043d\u044f: What role will Guilds play in Metis governance in the long term?\nDaryl: Governance will increasingly shift to contribution and reputation-based voting. Guild participation will play a significant role in how influence is earned and applied.\n\u041d\u0430\u0444\u0430\u043d\u044f (follow-up): How will the effectiveness of different Guilds be measured?\nDaryl: We use internal dashboards and Discourse reports to monitor activity. It\u2019s all about meaningful engagement\u2014Discourse\u2019s systems help surface the most valuable contributions and members.\nKaran Singhania: What will happen to early bird leaderboard points now that that phase is over? Will top scorers be rewarded?\nDaryl: Yes. Early bird points will be rewarded at a higher rate. Those who participated early will receive special recognition.\nH\u00fcseyin Tekin: How does the Guild model connect with Metis\u2019 long-term vision for decentralized governance? What metrics are used to assess authenticity and performance?\nDaryl: We combine social and onchain signals\u2014like forum activity, testnet deployments, and contract usage. Different signals contribute to different areas of influence. Governance, ultimately, is about enabling action and Guilds will empower users to do exactly that.\nFinal Note\nThe maiden edition of the Metis Telegram AMA brought rich insights into how the Hyperion Forum and Guilds Campaign are creating a powerful community infrastructure. This isn\u2019t just a discussion space\u2014it\u2019s a contributor economy with real visibility, leadership paths, and long-term rewards.\nBecome a Guild Leader\nWhether you\u2019re a builder, marketer, or operator\u2014Guild leadership is open to all. Metis is selecting three Guild Leaders in the coming weeks. Leaders will shape their Guild\u2019s direction, receive unique rewards, and gain authority in the broader ecosystem.\nApply now:\nforms.clickup.com\nClickUp Forms\nJoin the campaign.

Why are Guilds so important to the long-term vision?\nDaryl: The goal is to create specialized, high-signal communities where project teams can find support, share challenges, and scale together. The Forum becomes a place where teams can get actual help\u2014like figuring out user needs, audit readiness, or getting testers\u2014directly from peers in the ecosystem.\nNorbert: What does it take to become a Guild Leader? What kind of activity or traits are you looking for?\nDaryl: To qualify, you need a few key badges:\nMember (TL2)\nCampaigner (invited 3 members)\nAppreciated (received 1 like on 20 posts)\nCertified and Licensed (advanced forum knowledge) These metrics prove someone is active, helpful, and understands how to guide others.\nNorbert: What are the rewards for Guild Leaders, both now and in the future?\nDaryl: Immediate rewards include special titles, wallet perks like zero gas, and exclusive badges. Long-term, Guild Leaders could receive METIS token incentives, expanded governance roles, early access to new features, and scaled rewards based on their Guild\u2019s performance.\nNorbert: What responsibilities will Guild Leaders have?\nDaryl: Guild Leaders manage membership, moderate posts, set permissions, and guide their communities. Think of it as collaborative leadership, not admin control. You\u2019re there to help your Guild thrive\u2014not just enforce rules.\nNorbert: Are there long-term incentives tied to leadership performance?\nDaryl: Yes\u2014though we\u2019re not disclosing everything just yet. There\u2019s a real budget set aside, and Guild Leaders who scale their communities meaningfully will be rewarded even more.\nNorbert: Can people create new Guilds beyond the current three?\nDaryl: Not at this stage. We\u2019re focusing on growing the three core Guilds to build critical mass. New Guilds could emerge later once engagement is high enough. We want to avoid early fragmentation.\nCommunity Q&A\nBrownhawks_Degen: Is the Guild initiative open to everyone? What stops users from spamming the system?\nDaryl: Yes, anyone can join Guilds. We use Discourse, which has powerful built-in moderation and spam detection tools. We\u2019ve also enabled AI-assisted moderation for added security.\nDo\u011fukan: What real-world challenges are being used to validate AI-native dApps, and how is success measured?\nDaryl: This is a great topic for the Builders Guild. Feel free to post it there to spark a deeper discussion.\n\u041d\u0430\u0444\u0430\u043d\u044f: What role will Guilds play in Metis governance in the long term?\nDaryl: Governance will increasingly shift to contribution and reputation-based voting. Guild participation will play a significant role in how influence is earned and applied.\n\u041d\u0430\u0444\u0430\u043d\u044f (follow-up): How will the effectiveness of different Guilds be measured?\nDaryl: We use internal dashboards and Discourse reports to monitor activity. It\u2019s all about meaningful engagement\u2014Discourse\u2019s systems help surface the most valuable contributions and members.\nKaran Singhania: What will happen to early bird leaderboard points now that that phase is over? Will top scorers be rewarded?\nDaryl: Yes. Early bird points will be rewarded at a higher rate. Those who participated early will receive special recognition.\nH\u00fcseyin Tekin: How does the Guild model connect with Metis\u2019 long-term vision for decentralized governance? What metrics are used to assess authenticity and performance?\nDaryl: We combine social and onchain signals\u2014like forum activity, testnet deployments, and contract usage. Different signals contribute to different areas of influence. Governance, ultimately, is about enabling action and Guilds will empower users to do exactly that.\nFinal Note\nThe maiden edition of the Metis Telegram AMA brought rich insights into how the Hyperion Forum and Guilds Campaign are creating a powerful community infrastructure. This isn\u2019t just a discussion space\u2014it\u2019s a contributor economy with real visibility, leadership paths, and long-term rewards.\nBecome a Guild Leader\nWhether you\u2019re a builder, marketer, or operator\u2014Guild leadership is open to all. Metis is selecting three Guild Leaders in the coming weeks. Leaders will shape their Guild\u2019s direction, receive unique rewards, and gain authority in the broader ecosystem.\nApply now:\nforms.clickup.com\nClickUp Forms\nJoin the campaign.

                "comment": "This is an interesting proposal from Joseph! KnightGuard aims to tackle a significant problem in Nigeria and Africa related to land ownership and fraudulent claims, leveraging AI, geospatial data, and blockchain technology.\nHere are some of my thoughts and potential discussion points:\nProblem Validation: The problem statement is clear and well-articulated. Land conflicts and fraud are indeed major issues in many African countries.\nSolution Novelty: The combination of AI-powered geospatial analysis with NFT-based land ownership is innovative. Using Turf.js for overlap detection and OpenStreetMap for land use suggestions seems like a practical approach.\nTechnical Feasibility: While ambitious, the project appears technically feasible. The listed features and tasks are achievable with existing technologies. PostGIS could be very useful for efficiently storing and querying the geospatial data.\nCommunity Engagement: The proposed community engagement features (testable tasks, points system, gamified experience) are a good way to incentivize participation and build a strong community around the project.\nPotential Challenges:\nData Accuracy: The accuracy of the land polygon data and OpenStreetMap data is crucial. How will KnightGuard ensure the data is up-to-date and reliable?\nScalability: Handling a large number of land NFTs and geospatial queries efficiently could be a challenge.\nAdoption: Getting landowners, buyers, and government agencies to adopt the system may require significant effort.\nSuggestions:\nConsider integrating with existing land registries where possible.\nExplore using satellite imagery for land use analysis in addition to OpenStreetMap.\nFocus on building partnerships with local communities and government agencies.\nI recommend these next steps:\nInquire About Data Sources: Ask Joseph about the primary data sources for land polygons and how they plan to address data accuracy and potential discrepancies.\nDiscuss Scalability: Explore the project\u2019s plans for handling a large volume of geospatial data and NFT transactions.\nEncourage Community Feedback: Encourage other community members to provide feedback on the project and its potential impact.\nSuggest a Prototype: Building a small-scale prototype to demonstrate the core features and gather user feedback would be valuable.\nThis project has the potential to make a real difference in addressing land ownership issues in Africa. I\u2019m excited to see how it develops!"

                "comment": "Absolutely agree that the role of KOLs is evolving and fast. The shift toward community ownership and on-chain credibility is not just refreshing, it\u2019s necessary. But I also think centralized systems still have a role to play in supporting this transition, especially for emerging creators.\nPlatforms like Twitter/X, YouTube, and TikTok might be algorithm-driven, but they\u2019ve also taught KOLs how to build storytelling skills, cultivate audience loyalty, and create replicable engagement models. These systems, while flawed, provided the infrastructure that made many Web3-native voices visible in the first place.\nThe opportunity now is to bridge that centralized reach with decentralized ownership. KOLs who understand how to leverage both worlds those who use centralized platforms for discovery and decentralized ones for trust-building will dominate this next era.\nAlso, let\u2019s not overlook the potential for centralized platforms to evolve. We\u2019re already seeing integrations like token gating, digital collectibles, and off-platform DAOs being linked via social bios and communities. It\u2019s not an either/or it\u2019s about stacking influence across multiple layers.\nWeb3 KOLs aren\u2019t ditching their past tools they\u2019re just using them smarter.\nI am curious to see who\u2019s doing this well already. Any standout examples?"

        "content": "Project Name\nNovaStrike: AI-Driven Ghibli-Inspired Web3 Multiplayer Shooting Adventure\nProblem Statement\nCurrent multiplayer blockchain shooting games often lack deep AI-driven interactions, emotional engagement, and dynamic player ecosystems. Players experience static NPC behavior, limited meaningful communication, and unfair matchmaking. This reduces player immersion and community building in Web3 gaming environments.\nSolution Overview\nNovaStrike leverages advanced AI to create an emotionally rich, adaptive multiplayer shooting game world inspired by Ghibli aesthetics, where NPCs and game systems interact naturally with players. Integrating wallet-based accounts and staking, the game ensures fair matchmaking, dynamic in-game economies, evolving social reputation systems, and a rewarding event structure. AI assistants provide personalized coaching, behavioral moderation, and wallet management, making gameplay immersive and inclusive. This blend of AI and Web3 innovation redefines player engagement and fairness.\nProject Description\nNovaStrike is a unique multiplayer shooting game where up to 8 players enter limited-time game rooms connected via their crypto wallets and staking tokens. The world is fully AI-driven: NPCs powered by intelligent APIs interact emotionally, manage stores, offer quests, and respond dynamically to player actions. Players engage in shooting combat against NPCs and other players, can work jobs, trade, or steal coins within the session. Upon death, all session-earned assets are lost, raising the stakes and encouraging strategic play.\nAn event system provides players with timed or special tasks that reward in-game coins or tokens when completed. These earnings allow players to purchase permanent assets, character skins, and premium items. Using tokens, players can unlock exclusive content and upgrades, enhancing customization and gameplay advantages.\nAI systems continuously analyze player gameplay, communication, and wallet activity to assign honor scores and provide real-time behavioral feedback. Sofia, the AI assistant, acts as a companion and coach, comparing player profiles, offering tips, and managing historical data for improved play. Additionally, Sofia can securely manage players\u2019 wallets by facilitating crypto actions such as token transactions, in-game coin transfers, and payments to other players or game entities, streamlining economic interactions within the game ecosystem.\nPlayers compete for points by surviving combat, strategic asset management, completing event tasks, and collaborating or competing within the time-limited rooms; the top scorer wins game coins usable for permanent assets or characters, fostering long-term engagement.\nThe project combines blockchain\u2019s transparency with adaptive AI to create a socially aware, fair, and immersive shooting game where every decision and shot counts. The Ghibli-inspired art style adds emotional warmth, drawing players into a magical yet challenging world.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nTestable Features/Tasks:\nAccount creation and wallet staking integration\nJoining multiplayer shooting rooms and interacting with AI NPCs\nEngaging in shooting combat and strategic asset management\nParticipating in event-based tasks and missions to earn coins\nPerforming jobs and trading in AI-managed stores\nCommunicating with players/NPCs monitored by AI honor system\nReceiving coaching and feedback from Sofia AI assistant\nUtilizing AI for wallet management and crypto transactions\nPoints System:\n10 points for completing account setup and wallet connection\n20 points for joining and completing a game room session\n15 points for successful trades or jobs completed\n25 points for completing event tasks\n30 points for winning or scoring top in a shooting combat session\n10 points for positive social behavior (as rated by AI)\nBonus points for engaging with AI assistant coaching\nGamification & Onboarding: Tasks incentivize users to explore core gameplay, AI features, event missions, and wallet interactions, rewarding positive engagement and strategic play. The points system encourages repeated play and fosters community competition, boosting user retention and word-of-mouth growth.\nGetting Involved\nCommunity members can join by:\nConnecting their wallets to participate in early game sessions, staking, and event missions\nProviding feedback on AI NPC behavior, matchmaking fairness, gameplay balance, event design, and wallet transaction flows\nTesting communication moderation and honor system features\nJoining development discussions and contributing ideas on social platforms\nHelping create Ghibli-inspired art, story elements, or in-game content\nParticipating in beta testing and sharing user experience data\nEarly adopters and contributors will be rewarded with exclusive NFTs, in-game assets, and opportunities to shape the future of NovaStrike.",

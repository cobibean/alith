By lowering the entry barrier for newer developers, it expands the developer base and helps the ecosystem grow.\nThe gamified features also incentivize real-world testing, knowledge-sharing, and data collection to continuously improve both LogiQ and Alith.\nFuture Roadmap\nReal-time browser extension for dApp logs\nVS Code plugin for inline EVM error hints\nCI/CD hooks that stop faulty contracts pre-deploy\nOpen-source knowledge base of resolved log cases"

It helps users in real-time during courses and quizzes, and also powers our Telegram bot (@aiva_help_bot). The responses are fast (usually ~2\u20133s ), and it\u2019s designed to give helpful guidance instead of direct answers, making learning more interactive\nHintAgent \u2013 a supporting agent that specifically handles quiz-related hints. When students get stuck, it provides small nudges without revealing the answer, helping them think through the problem\nProgressTrackerAgent \u2013 a backend agent that connects to our smart contract. When someone completes a quiz, this agent verifies it and writes an on-chain credential to the user\u2019s record. So learning isn\u2019t just interactive \u2014 it\u2019s verifiable and Web3-native\nWhat really stood out with Alith is the dev-first design . You define agent roles and behavior with clean config, routing is built-in, and you don\u2019t need to worry about complex orchestration \u2014 agents just work\nWe\u2019re still in testing, but things are stable \u2014 and we\u2019re planning to add more AI agents soon (like progress analyzers and personalized course planners)"

        "content": "If you\u2019ve worked in DevRel for traditional dev tools (APIs, infra, SaaS), jumping into AI or Web3 is like switching to a different game entirely.\nI\u2019ve been living in this world, and here\u2019s the truth: DevRel here is more than just docs and DX (Developer Experience) \u2014 it\u2019s education, trust-building, and legit community shaping.\nHere\u2019s what makes DevRel in AI and Blockchain startups different \u2014 and why it matters more than people think\n1. You\u2019re Not Just Teaching a Tool \u2014 You\u2019re Teaching a Whole New Paradigm\nIn AI, you\u2019re helping devs rethink how to build:\nLLMs, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, embeddings \u2014 this stuff didn\u2019t even exist in most stacks 2 years ago.\nIn Web3, you\u2019re explaining wallets, signing, smart contracts, gas fees\u2026 to people used to centralized systems.\nDevRel here is 80% education, 20% product.\n2. Skepticism Is High \u2014 You\u2019re Also a Trust Builder\nA lot of devs are burned out on hype (especially in crypto). They\u2019ve seen rug pulls, broken promises, and overhyped AI demos.\nIf you\u2019re doing DevRel in this space, your job is proving your project isn\u2019t vaporware.\nThat means:\nClear roadmaps\nHonest answers in Discord\nTransparent docs\nReal working examples\n3. Everything Is Moving Way Too Fast\nAI frameworks update weekly. Web3 protocols hard fork while you\u2019re still updating your last tutorial.\nYou need to:\nShip content fast\nStay plugged into community convos\nBe okay with some docs going out of date in a week\nSpeed matters more than polish here.\n4. Community Is the Moat\nIn early-stage AI and Web3, your developer community is your distribution.\nIf you can turn your early users into champions \u2014 people who:\nShip on your stack\nSpeak at events\nAnswer questions for othersThat\u2019s your growth engine.\nYou\u2019re not just \u201chelping developers\u201d \u2014 you\u2019re empowering your first believers.\n5.

                "comment": "If you\u2019ve worked in DevRel for traditional dev tools (APIs, infra, SaaS), jumping into AI or Web3 is like switching to a different game entirely.\nI\u2019ve been living in this world, and here\u2019s the truth: DevRel here is more than just docs and DX (Developer Experience) \u2014 it\u2019s education, trust-building, and legit community shaping.\nHere\u2019s what makes DevRel in AI and Blockchain startups different \u2014 and why it matters more than people think\n1. You\u2019re Not Just Teaching a Tool \u2014 You\u2019re Teaching a Whole New Paradigm\nIn AI, you\u2019re helping devs rethink how to build:\nLLMs, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, embeddings \u2014 this stuff didn\u2019t even exist in most stacks 2 years ago.\nIn Web3, you\u2019re explaining wallets, signing, smart contracts, gas fees\u2026 to people used to centralized systems.\nDevRel here is 80% education, 20% product.\n2. Skepticism Is High \u2014 You\u2019re Also a Trust Builder\nA lot of devs are burned out on hype (especially in crypto). They\u2019ve seen rug pulls, broken promises, and overhyped AI demos.\nIf you\u2019re doing DevRel in this space, your job is proving your project isn\u2019t vaporware.\nThat means:\nClear roadmaps\nHonest answers in Discord\nTransparent docs\nReal working examples\n3. Everything Is Moving Way Too Fast\nAI frameworks update weekly. Web3 protocols hard fork while you\u2019re still updating your last tutorial.\nYou need to:\nShip content fast\nStay plugged into community convos\nBe okay with some docs going out of date in a week\nSpeed matters more than polish here.\n4. Community Is the Moat\nIn early-stage AI and Web3, your developer community is your distribution.\nIf you can turn your early users into champions \u2014 people who:\nShip on your stack\nSpeak at events\nAnswer questions for othersThat\u2019s your growth engine.\nYou\u2019re not just \u201chelping developers\u201d \u2014 you\u2019re empowering your first believers.\n5. Your Role Isn\u2019t Just Technical \u2014 It\u2019s Strategic\nIn these spaces, DevRel often drives product feedback, brand tone, go-to-market motion, even hiring.\nStartups here are lean, so DevRel = Swiss Army knife.\nTL;DR:\nDoing DevRel for AI or Blockchain isn\u2019t just about better docs or DX.\nIt\u2019s about education, speed, trust, and building a movement before the product even stabilizes.\nIt\u2019s not easy \u2014 but it\u2019s probably the most impactful DevRel work you\u2019ll ever do."

        "content": "Project Name\nHBCO2- Transparency and clarity in carbon credit usage\nProblem Statement\nThe traditional carbon credit and offset system faces significant challenges, including a lack of transparency, where transactions and retirements are often not publicly visible, making it hard to verify credit usage and prevent double-counting or fraud. Fragmented registries with inconsistent formats, manual and slow verification processes, and limited market access for small buyers further complicate the system. Additionally, opaque retirement claims make it difficult for the public to verify companies\u2019 offset assertions, undermining trust in the market.\nThe challenges of the traditional carbon credit and offset system impact a wide range of stakeholders. Corporates and buyers struggle with opaque pricing and unverifiable offset claims when trying to meet emission reduction goals, while project developers face slow, costly approval processes and limited access to global markets. Auditors and verifiers waste time reconciling fragmented data across disparate registries, regulators and policymakers lack real-time data for effective enforcement and reporting, and retail or small investors are excluded due to high entry barriers, complex onboarding, and illiquid markets.\nSolution Overview\nA blockchain-based tokenization system for carbon credits offers a transparent, tamper-proof, and globally accessible solution to the inefficiencies of the traditional carbon market. By converting verified carbon credits into digital tokens on-chain, each transaction \u2014 from issuance to retirement \u2014 becomes auditable in real time, eliminating double counting and fraud. Smart contracts automate credit lifecycle events, reducing the need for manual intermediaries and accelerating verification and trading.\nThis approach is innovative because it democratizes access through fractional ownership and DeFi integration, enabling broader participation and liquidity. Its uniqueness lies in combining environmental integrity with financial innovation, creating a trusted, scalable infrastructure for climate action.\nProject Description\nHBCO2 is a blockchain-based platform that tokenizes carbon credits, bringing unprecedented transparency, accessibility, and efficiency to carbon markets. The core functionality revolves around converting verified carbon credits from trusted registries (e.g., Verra, Gold Standard) into digital tokens on the blockchain, ensuring every credit is traceable, auditable, and tamper-proof from issuance to retirement.\nKey features include:\nTokenized carbon credits (ERC-20 / Hyperion) representing 1 ton of CO\u2082 each\nSmart contract-powered registry to track minting, trading, and burning of carbon tokens\nReal-time proof of retirement, enabling verifiable ESG claims\nDecentralized marketplace for credit trading and fractional ownership\nDashboard for corporates and individuals to track offset activity and impact\nThe platform can leverage Ethereum (for DeFi liquidity), Hyperion (for interoperability and scalability), and IPFS or Chainlink oracles for verifiable data integration (e.g., satellite imagery or project audit results). Off-chain registries are bridged on-chain via a proof-based retirement mechanism, ensuring integrity at every step.\nUsers \u2014 from individuals to corporations \u2014 can offset emissions transparently, trade credits, or support verified green projects. Small contributors can access fractionalized tokens, while enterprises gain regulatory-grade audit trails for sustainability reporting.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nUsers can begin by connecting their crypto wallet, completing an optional KYC process, and taking an onboarding quiz designed to educate them on carbon markets and tokenized offsets. As they explore tokenized green projects, vote on future initiatives, or retire carbon credits to claim digital proof of impact, they earn points for each action. Tasks such as staking tokens, inviting friends through referral links, and sharing retirement certificates on social media further enhance engagement and virality.\nGetting Involved\nHBCO2 welcomes passionate contributors to co-create a transparent, blockchain-based carbon credit ecosystem. Whether you\u2019re a developer, climate advocate, or curious learner, there are multiple ways to get involved.\nDevelopers can contribute to smart contracts, UI/UX, or integrations via our open-source GitHub. Early adopters can join the beta program to test features like offsetting, governance voting, and gamified dashboards \u2014 with feedback directly shaping the product. Community members can become ambassadors, spread the mission, and earn rewards by sharing content or referrals. Project owners can submit verified climate projects to be tokenized on-chain.\nHow is your product differ from these: Toucan, KlimaDAO, and Flowcarbon:\nWhile these platforms focus immensely on providing Infrastructure for tokenizing real-world carbon credits onto the blockchain i.e. create demand-side market maker and treasury-backed protocol to drive the on-chain carbon economy, there are still some common problems not addressed by them. They do not deal with the issues of data integrity at source. These products/platforms do not solve the on-ground accuracy and real-time transparency of how carbon credits are generated or validated. They rely heavily on legacy registries and do not have a Decentralized and automated measurement/reporting/verification mechanism or a tamper-proof data submission mechanism. This is a critical area to address the concern of junk credits. We are addressing these issues by directly integrating real-time data, and AI for automatic carbon measurement and reporting, build verifiable data trails for credit issuance using decentralized identity and attestations, build a public, tamper-proof registry that supports Real-time credit issuance, could plug into existing registries or create a community-driven one.\nOne more valued differentiator we are incorporating in our solution is integrating standardized native ESG reporting (e.g., GRI, SASB, TCFD). This feature offers clear and strategic business advantages, particularly for attracting enterprises, investors, and regulators. This feature is not part of these above 3 products in market. This makes our solution a dual-use tool i.e. both for carbon credit tokenization and ESG compliance, which is highly attractive to sustainability teams and CFOs.\nHow does your product utilize Hyperion\u2019s unique features in your product offering:\nHyperion has great features as explained in metis.io/hyperion documentation. Hyperion\u2019s architecture makes it a strong candidate for climate + compliance-grade blockchain applications. Here are the features that our solution will utilize:\nOptimistic Rollups + Parallel Execution: Carbon tokenization involves many state changes (bridging, minting, retiring, verifying). Parallel execution enables non-blocking, real-time carbon issuance and credit retirement. Optimistic rollups make this cost-effective and scalable, while still benefiting from Ethereum\u2019s Layer 1 security.\nDecentralized Sequencing: Sequencer decentralization prevents central authorities from manipulating transaction ordering\u2014key for auditable ESG data (e.g., who retired what carbon, when). Helps build regulatory trust in ESG data derived from blockchain. Makes our product more compliant with assurance frameworks like TCFD and CSRD\nEthereum Compatibility (EVM): Interoperability with DeFi and existing carbon token standards. Enables integration with liquidity protocols, NFT-based sustainability assets, and DAO governance. Can also easily plug into Metamask, Chainlink, etc. This results in Fast dev cycles + rich integration ecosystem for carbon/ESG innovation.\nWhat bounty track are you applying to:\nTrack1: Hyperion AI Integration \u2014 Projects using Hyperion\u2019s built-in AI co-agent",

A cryptographic hash can guarantee a dataset\u2019s integrity, but it cannot verify its origin, quality, or content. A creator could claim their AI is trained on financial data when it was actually trained on irrelevant information, and the hash would still be valid.\nThis \u201csemantic gap\u201d creates a trust vacuum, preventing developers from confidently building high-stakes applications that rely on third-party AI agents.\nThe Solution\nHaithe is a trust protocol that solves this problem by creating a transparent, verifiable ecosystem for AI. We move beyond simple integrity checks to a system of substantive verification, enabled by three key roles: Creators, Consumers, and Auditors.\nInstead of just registering a data hash, creators submit a detailed Claim Manifest about their dataset. Staked domain experts, acting as Auditors, are granted temporary, private access to investigate these claims. Their findings are published in a granular, on-chain Audit Report, allowing consumers to make informed decisions based on expert, independent verification.\nHow It Works: A Three-Part Ecosystem\nHaithe\u2019s workflow ensures checks and balances between all participants, with smart contracts on Hyperion orchestrating the process.\n1. The Creator: Defining the Claims\nBuild & Register: Developers use the Alith framework to build high-performance AI agents and register them on the Haithe marketplace.\nSubmit the Claim Manifest: Alongside the agent, the Creator submits a structured manifest containing specific, falsifiable claims about the training data. For example:\nSource: \u201cAPI data from Uniswap v3 on Polygon.\u201d\nDate Range: \u201cAll swaps from June 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023.\u201d\nContent: \u201cDataset contains no personally identifiable information (PII).\u201d\nSchema: \u201cIncludes columns for token_pair, amount_in, amount_out, and gas_price.\u201d\n2. The Auditor: Investigating the Substance\nStake & Qualify: Domain experts (in finance, NLP, security, etc.) stake tokens to become eligible Auditors.\nAccept the Task: An Auditor accepts an audit request, which can be funded by the Creator or a Consumer.\nInvestigate Claims: The Auditor is granted secure, time-limited, off-chain access to the private dataset. Their role is to meticulously investigate the claims made in the manifest. This requires genuine domain expertise.\nPublish the Audit Report: The Auditor submits a detailed report to IPFS, with its hash recorded on-chain. This report confirms or refutes each claim individually, providing qualitative remarks.\n3. The Consumer: Making Informed Decisions\nDiscover & Filter: Developers browse the Haithe marketplace for AI agents. They can filter for agents based on their audit status.\nReview Reports: Before subscribing, a Consumer can review the detailed Audit Report for any agent. This allows them to assess if the agent\u2019s verified characteristics fit their specific use case.\nIntegrate with Confidence: Armed with expert-verified information, the Consumer can confidently integrate the agent into their dApp, knowing exactly what they are getting.\nKey Features\nOn-Chain Claim Manifests: Creators make specific, verifiable claims about their AI\u2019s data foundation.\nExpert-Led Audits: Audits are performed by staked domain experts, not just automated checkers.\nGranular Audit Reports: Replaces a simple pass/fail with a detailed report that verifies individual claims.\nDecentralized Access Control: A secure mechanism grants auditors temporary, private access to datasets for verification.\nIncentive-Aligned Ecosystem: Creators are rewarded for building great agents, and Auditors are rewarded for providing high-quality, trustworthy verification.\nBuilt for Performance: Powered by the Alith AI framework and the Hyperion blockchain for high throughput and low fees.\nTechnology Stack\nBlockchain: Hyperion\nAI Framework: Alith\nSmart Contracts: Solidity\nDecentralized Storage: IPFS / Arweave for datasets and audit reports\nCommunity & Testing\nHaithe is an ecosystem, and its strength comes from its community. We invite you to participate in our testnet by taking on one of the core roles:\nBecome a Creator: Build a simple agent with Alith, deploy it on our platform, and create a Claim Manifest for it.\nAct as a Consumer: Browse the marketplace, review the claims and audit reports of existing agents, and integrate them into a test application.\nJoin the Auditor Program: If you have domain expertise, apply to our Auditor program to help verify claims and build the foundation of trust for the ecosystem.",

Thanks again for your interest in our project and for the thoughtful questions. Let me address each of them below\n1) If the dataset is private, how do you ensure Auditors don\u2019t misuse or leak it?\nGreat question. In our current model, auditors must undergo two layers of validation before they\u2019re granted access:\nFirst, they are verified by us (the platform) based on identity and domain expertise.\nSecond, they are validated by the DAO, ensuring community-level accountability.\nWhile trust in auditors is still required to some extent, just like in real-world auditing , we are actively exploring ways to make this process more trustless.\n2) Are Creators allowed to challenge an audit report if they think it\u2019s unfair or inaccurate?\nYes, it\u2019s a crucial safeguard.\nWe agree that auditors shouldn\u2019t have unchecked authority. Creators will have the ability to challenge audit reports, either by:\nRequesting a re-audit (potentially by a different auditor or group of auditors), or\nSubmitting a formal rebuttal that gets appended to the audit report for transparency.\n3) What kinds of use cases are you targeting first \u2013 trading bots, oracles, LLMs?\nOur initial focus is on trading bots and LLMs. These use cases have both high impact and urgent need for trust and verifiability."

Each audit report goes into technical detail, verifying every claim made in the agent\u2019s Claim Manifest \u2014 like the data source, date range, schema, and more.\nAnd yes, confidence naturally increases when multiple auditors review the same dataset. The more popular or high-quality a dataset is, the more likely it is to attract repeat audits, giving you a broader and more trustworthy view."

Also, spending some time checking some of the blue checkmark accounts engaging with that post can help. That way, you can better understand whether these are real accounts posting meaningful content and genuinely engaging with the KOL, or if they\u2019re likely botted or bought accounts.\nConsistent track record \u2013 Evaluate the influencer\u2019s history in promoting projects. A KOL/influencer who is known for long-term support of a project, consistently shows up, and puts their face/voice out there is another good sign.\nCheck the consistency of their voice \u2013 A KOL who frequently changes opinions or jumps between projects might just be chasing the best payouts rather than aiming to bring value. Changing one\u2019s mind occasionally isn\u2019t always a bad sign, but if it happens often, it\u2019s definitely a red flag.\nAdditionals thing are out there, I believe also very important to use some of the tools out there also to check followers, and so on, and especially disconnect and be far from the idea that \u201cA lot of followers, likes= high quality\u201d"

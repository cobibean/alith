From the beginning, our aim has been consistent: not to be another Layer 2, but to build infrastructure that evolves, experiments, and sets the direction for tomorrow. We began by scaling Ethereum and have steadily expanded toward a future where blockchain and AI move together.\nTraditional L2s need upgrading. That is why we built Hyperion, our AI-optimized infrastructure layer that raises throughput and lowers latency. But infrastructure alone is not enough. To bring communities in, we must layer playability and meaningful interactions on top.\nLazAI, our application and data layer, is where playability comes alive. It makes infrastructure interactive, aligns with market demand, and builds community confidence.\nMetis is the beta ground for new bets, the place where daring ideas are tested, refined, and scaled before they shape the industry at large. As we continue this path, we must grow together, anchored by trust and clarity.\nA Toolkit for One Economy: From Settlement to Playability\nMetis\u2019s strength is in its unity. We are not scattering value into silos; we are building a connected toolkit under one economy.\nAndromeda serves as the settlement and trading layer. Hyperion expands that base with scalable compute, optimized for AI dApps that demand high throughput and low latency. Together, they form the infrastructure. On top sits LazAI, serving as the application layer, transforming this foundation into playability, points, data, and AI-driven value.\nStep by step, the toolkit expands. Value builds as the layers connect. Recent milestones show this evolution in motion. Andromeda continues as the battle-tested motherchain. HyperHack drew more than 100 active Hyperion builders. LazAI Testnet launched with Lazbubu proving real playability. Our AI Companion DAT Lazbubu enrolled over 90k participants in the Whitelist Campaign and over 10,000 DAT mints.\nPutting Users First in the Journey\nParticipation begins with simple entry points that spark curiosity. From there, users move into richer experiences where AI, data, and community features make engagement meaningful.\nThe path is clear. LazAI incubates agents and applications through LazPad, while users earn, mint, and interact with data assets that mature into broader use cases on Andromeda. Lazbubu is the first step, showing how evolving AI Companions can anchor this journey.\nThese are not static NFTs, but AI agents that evolve over time, transforming innovation into experiences that align with market demand and foster confidence within our community.\nClosing\nAs I shared in a previous letter, our strength comes from trust and clarity. The earlier you take part in these new layers, the more your participation will guide their growth, and over time your efforts may be recognized in ways that matter.\nMetis is shaping the beta ground for the next era. With clear paths for participation through LazAI and Lazbubu, and with a culture that dares while staying principled, we are ready for what\u2019s next.\nThis is not the time to stand still. This is the time to lean in, experiment, and co-create the future.\nTogether, we will make Metis not just a network but the proving ground where tomorrow\u2019s breakthroughs are born.\n\u2014 Elena Sinelnikova",

It got me thinking about how developers could leverage AI to improve scalability and performance without compromising decentralization. For projects focused on AI-native applications, this seems like a practical way to experiment with intelligent, data-driven smart contracts.\nAnother insight was around dual-chain architectures. Natalia discussed how separating chains for different tasks can empower developers to build more efficient and scalable decentralized apps. This connects to some ongoing discussions here about decentralized sequencers and multi-chain strategies \u2014 it seems like a natural evolution for projects struggling with throughput and transaction costs.\nI\u2019m curious to hear what others think:\nHow do you see AI integration shaping the next wave of Web3 projects?\nHave any of you experimented with dual-chain or Layer 2 solutions in your apps? What challenges or benefits did you notice?\nWhat are the biggest obstacles for AI-native projects in a decentralized ecosystem \u2014 adoption, infrastructure, or something else?\nWould love to get your thoughts and experiences \u2014 especially if you\u2019re already exploring AI-driven features in your projects.",

For projects focused on AI-native applications, this seems like a practical way to experiment with intelligent, data-driven smart contracts.\nAnother insight was around dual-chain architectures. Natalia discussed how separating chains for different tasks can empower developers to build more efficient and scalable decentralized apps. This connects to some ongoing discussions here about decentralized sequencers and multi-chain strategies \u2014 it seems like a natural evolution for projects struggling with throughput and transaction costs.\nI\u2019m curious to hear what others think:\nHow do you see AI integration shaping the next wave of Web3 projects?\nHave any of you experimented with dual-chain or Layer 2 solutions in your apps? What challenges or benefits did you notice?\nWhat are the biggest obstacles for AI-native projects in a decentralized ecosystem \u2014 adoption, infrastructure, or something else?\nWould love to get your thoughts and experiences \u2014 especially if you\u2019re already exploring AI-driven features in your projects."

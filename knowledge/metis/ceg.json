It\u2019s easier on the eyes and gives more space to what matters: the product itself.\nI still love a good dark theme when it\u2019s done right (like Zapper or Revoke.cash).

                "comment": "Since a lot of people treat the crypto industry as a public way to get into private investing (i.e. invest into startups before they list on a stock exchange), narrative sadly takes up a disproportionate amount of the crypto marketing space.\nOn the other hand, narrative is an indispensable part of good marketing in ANY industry. Even when you\u2019re actively trying to craft narrative, it\u2019s unavoidable.\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re selling a carrot in the farmer\u2019s market with no booth, no signage, just a basket of carrots and your voice yelling out the price. There\u2019s still an unconscious narrative - it\u2019s fresh, it\u2019s direct from the farm, and it\u2019s a good deal. Then the audience sees the carrot, and can either confirm or reject the premises and make their purchasing decision.\nLike you said, narrative drives attention and product keeps it. Narrative is also inevitable, but product is what\u2019s sought after."

Or is narrative just the native language of a still-immature industry? And how do you balance storytelling with real value?\nCurious to hear how others are thinking about this.\nThis is spot on. In crypto, narrative isn\u2019t just marketing it\u2019s infrastructure. It\u2019s what gets people to care before they even understand the tech.\nReminds me of what Steve Jobs said: \u201cThe most powerful person in the world is the storyteller.\u201d That\u2019s literally crypto in a nutshell. The best protocols don\u2019t just build, they narrate a future people want to believe in.\nOf course, tech has to eventually deliver. But without a story, no one shows up to see it work. Balancing both is the real unlock."

Just type what you want, and it gives you options.\nChatGPT\nSuper flexible. You can ask it to help write emails, blogs, or product descriptions. Great if you\u2019re stuck or need a rough draft.\nJasper\nMore polished tool made for marketers. It\u2019s paid, but good for teams who want more structured output.\nEmail Marketing:\nMailchimp\nClassic tool, now with some AI features. Helps you send emails, create simple automation, and write better subject lines.\nBrevo (formerly Sendinblue)\nEasy to use for beginners. You can set up automated email flows (like welcome emails) without much setup.\nDesign & Ads:\nCanva\nSuper beginner-friendly. Their new AI tools can help you create designs, logos, and even videos quickly.\nAdCreative.ai\nIf you run Facebook or Google ads, this tool helps generate ad images and copy based on your product.\nTracking & Smart Suggestions:\nSurferSEO\nIf you\u2019re writing blog content, this helps you figure out what keywords to include so more people can find you on Google.\nHubSpot (Free Plan)\nSuitable for beginners who want to track leads, send emails, and use AI to help improve campaigns as you go.\nSimple Automations:\nZapier\nThink of it like a connector. You can set it up to do things like: \u201cWhen someone fills out a form, automatically send a welcome email.\u201d No coding needed.\nNotion AI\nIf you\u2019re organizing content or planning campaigns, this helps brainstorm, write, and organize everything in one place.\nIf you\u2019re just starting out, my advice is:\nPick one area to automate first (like email or social posts).\nStart with free tools or free trials.\nDon\u2019t worry about getting it perfect, just test and learn.\nThese tools won\u2019t replace real strategy or creativity, but they\u2019ll save you time and help you move faster.\nAnyone else have beginner-friendly AI tools they like?

        "content": "Haithe\nA Decentralized Protocol for Verifiable AI.\nThe Problem\nThe core challenge for AI in Web3 isn\u2019t just proving that data hasn\u2019t been tampered with; it\u2019s proving the data\u2019s substance. A cryptographic hash can guarantee a dataset\u2019s integrity, but it cannot verify its origin, quality, or content. A creator could claim their AI is trained on financial data when it was actually trained on irrelevant information, and the hash would still be valid.\nThis \u201csemantic gap\u201d creates a trust vacuum, preventing developers from confidently building high-stakes applications that rely on third-party AI agents.\nThe Solution\nHaithe is a trust protocol that solves this problem by creating a transparent, verifiable ecosystem for AI. We move beyond simple integrity checks to a system of substantive verification, enabled by three key roles: Creators, Consumers, and Auditors.\nInstead of just registering a data hash, creators submit a detailed Claim Manifest about their dataset. Staked domain experts, acting as Auditors, are granted temporary, private access to investigate these claims. Their findings are published in a granular, on-chain Audit Report, allowing consumers to make informed decisions based on expert, independent verification.\nHow It Works: A Three-Part Ecosystem\nHaithe\u2019s workflow ensures checks and balances between all participants, with smart contracts on Hyperion orchestrating the process.\n1. The Creator: Defining the Claims\nBuild & Register: Developers use the Alith framework to build high-performance AI agents and register them on the Haithe marketplace.\nSubmit the Claim Manifest: Alongside the agent, the Creator submits a structured manifest containing specific, falsifiable claims about the training data. For example:\nSource: \u201cAPI data from Uniswap v3 on Polygon.\u201d\nDate Range: \u201cAll swaps from June 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023.\u201d\nContent: \u201cDataset contains no personally identifiable information (PII).\u201d\nSchema: \u201cIncludes columns for token_pair, amount_in, amount_out, and gas_price.\u201d\n2. The Auditor: Investigating the Substance\nStake & Qualify: Domain experts (in finance, NLP, security, etc.) stake tokens to become eligible Auditors.\nAccept the Task: An Auditor accepts an audit request, which can be funded by the Creator or a Consumer.\nInvestigate Claims: The Auditor is granted secure, time-limited, off-chain access to the private dataset. Their role is to meticulously investigate the claims made in the manifest. This requires genuine domain expertise.\nPublish the Audit Report: The Auditor submits a detailed report to IPFS, with its hash recorded on-chain. This report confirms or refutes each claim individually, providing qualitative remarks.\n3. The Consumer: Making Informed Decisions\nDiscover & Filter: Developers browse the Haithe marketplace for AI agents. They can filter for agents based on their audit status.\nReview Reports: Before subscribing, a Consumer can review the detailed Audit Report for any agent. This allows them to assess if the agent\u2019s verified characteristics fit their specific use case.\nIntegrate with Confidence: Armed with expert-verified information, the Consumer can confidently integrate the agent into their dApp, knowing exactly what they are getting.\nKey Features\nOn-Chain Claim Manifests: Creators make specific, verifiable claims about their AI\u2019s data foundation.\nExpert-Led Audits: Audits are performed by staked domain experts, not just automated checkers.\nGranular Audit Reports: Replaces a simple pass/fail with a detailed report that verifies individual claims.\nDecentralized Access Control: A secure mechanism grants auditors temporary, private access to datasets for verification.\nIncentive-Aligned Ecosystem: Creators are rewarded for building great agents, and Auditors are rewarded for providing high-quality, trustworthy verification.\nBuilt for Performance: Powered by the Alith AI framework and the Hyperion blockchain for high throughput and low fees.\nTechnology Stack\nBlockchain: Hyperion\nAI Framework: Alith\nSmart Contracts: Solidity\nDecentralized Storage: IPFS / Arweave for datasets and audit reports\nCommunity & Testing\nHaithe is an ecosystem, and its strength comes from its community. We invite you to participate in our testnet by taking on one of the core roles:\nBecome a Creator: Build a simple agent with Alith, deploy it on our platform, and create a Claim Manifest for it.\nAct as a Consumer: Browse the marketplace, review the claims and audit reports of existing agents, and integrate them into a test application.\nJoin the Auditor Program: If you have domain expertise, apply to our Auditor program to help verify claims and build the foundation of trust for the ecosystem.",

Thanks again for your interest in our project and for the thoughtful questions. Let me address each of them below\n1) If the dataset is private, how do you ensure Auditors don\u2019t misuse or leak it?\nGreat question. In our current model, auditors must undergo two layers of validation before they\u2019re granted access:\nFirst, they are verified by us (the platform) based on identity and domain expertise.\nSecond, they are validated by the DAO, ensuring community-level accountability.\nWhile trust in auditors is still required to some extent, just like in real-world auditing , we are actively exploring ways to make this process more trustless.\n2) Are Creators allowed to challenge an audit report if they think it\u2019s unfair or inaccurate?\nYes, it\u2019s a crucial safeguard.\nWe agree that auditors shouldn\u2019t have unchecked authority. Creators will have the ability to challenge audit reports, either by:\nRequesting a re-audit (potentially by a different auditor or group of auditors), or\nSubmitting a formal rebuttal that gets appended to the audit report for transparency.\n3) What kinds of use cases are you targeting first \u2013 trading bots, oracles, LLMs?\nOur initial focus is on trading bots and LLMs. These use cases have both high impact and urgent need for trust and verifiability."

                "comment": "Helloo, Apologies for the delayed response, I really appreciate your thoughtful question!\nAs a consumer, audits are exactly what enable trust that an AI agent\u2019s data truly comes from the sources claimed. Each audit report goes into technical detail, verifying every claim made in the agent\u2019s Claim Manifest \u2014 like the data source, date range, schema, and more.\nAnd yes, confidence naturally increases when multiple auditors review the same dataset. The more popular or high-quality a dataset is, the more likely it is to attract repeat audits, giving you a broader and more trustworthy view."

        "content": "RugRadar: AI Due Diligence Scoring on Hyperion\nYour shield against scams & rugpools on Metis Hyperion\nProblem we\u2019re targeting:\nNearly one-in-two new EVM tokens today is linked to a rug-pull pattern, draining roughly USD 800 million from retail wallets every year (and that figure excludes protocol hacks and exploits), according to reports by Certic, Chainalysis & others. Blockchain watchdogs estimate 117 000+ scam tokens going live every year, impacting \u2248 2 million investors worldwide.\nThese numbers keep growing because anyone can launch a token, bypass real due diligence, and disappear with the money. Trust and user growth in Metis, and across all L2 ecosystems, will always be at risk as long as there is no fast, reliable, and transparent way for the average user to verify a project before investing.\nSolution Overview\nAlphaMind RugRadar is an open-source, on-chain AI scoring agent that analyses token projects in real time, anchors its findings to LazAI DATs, and exposes a transparent risk score before funds change hands.\nBuilt with Alith SDK and executed on Hyperion\u2019s AI-optimised roll-up, it delivers an open, explainable trust layer that:\nFlags suspicious launches instantly, protecting retail community.\nIncentivises reputable teams to address red-flags pre-IDO/pre-TGE.\nGenerates on-chain gas, feeding Metis Builder-Mining rewards and TVL.\nThis means an average user on Metis could instantly verify a project\u2019s risk before investing, preventing potential rug-pulls and fostering trust.\nBy making due diligence simple and accessible, we help both users, ecosystems and launchpads spot scams early and bring more trust to the ecosystem. This innovation not only protects users, but will also incentivize higher-quality project onboarding, filter applications for ecosystem grants and increase the attractiveness of Metis as a launch destination.\nOur agent is designed to get smarter and better over time, learning from new data and community feedback. RugRadar will be a flagship example of Hyperion\u2019s AI capabilities, proving that complex AI agents can run on-chain at L2 speeds and deliver value to the community.\nProject Description\nCore functionality: The agent ingests white-papers, GitHub commits, byte-code, tokenomics and social patterns, runs an LLM-driven rule-engine (Alith) plus anomaly heuristics, then mints a DAT-anchored report with a 0-100 risk score visible on chain & via UI/bot.\n\nRugRadar on Hyperion: process from project submission to on-chain report\nEach report is published as a DAT on Hyperion, so it\u2019s tamper-proof and easy to check by anyone.\nAutomated, explainable scoring: Real-time, explainable risk scores with transparent audit logs, viewable on-chain and through an intuitive UI.\nMulti-source intelligence: Integrates on-chain analytics, cross-references external data (e.g., audit reports, GitHub activity), and flags suspicious or non-transparent elements.\nCommunity signals: Allows user-submitted reviews, crowd-sourced data points, and historical feedback to improve the agent\u2019s accuracy.\nContinuous learning: The AI agent continuously updates its heuristics using feedback loops and on-chain data, improving detection over time.\nSimple web interface at launch, with a Telegram bot pilot for fast alerts and feedback (off-chain interaction, on-chain data access)\nTechnologies & Approach:\nAlith SDK: For natural language understanding, reasoning, and explainability.\nHyperion L2 infrastructure: For ultra-fast, low-cost inference and public data availability.\nDecentralized Attestation Technology (DAT): To anchor due diligence reports and scoring provenance.\nUI/UX layer: Web and Telegram bot for seamless investor access.\nWhy we believe in this idea?\nBecause the future of Web3 relies on open, community-owned, and transparent systems, not black-box ratings controlled by corporations or pay-to-play platforms. The Metis ecosystem, with Hyperion and LazAI, is designed specifically to break this paradigm.\nToday, most rating and due diligence platforms operate with closed-source, unverifiable models and monetise ratings by selling \u201ctop\u201d listings to startups, creating conflicts of interest and undermining trust.\nWe believe every investor and builder deserves a system where the rules, data, and scoring logic are public and auditable.\nBy training RugRadar on real launchpad data, publishing our agent and scoring logic as open source, and inviting the community to help shape the rules, we create not just a tool, but a living, evolving knowledge base for the entire ecosystem.\nThis approach fits perfectly with Metis\u2019 vision for decentralized, on-chain AI: one where you can always verify the logic behind every score, where collective wisdom improves the model, and where no one can buy a good rating behind closed doors.\nBy making due diligence radically transparent, crowd-powered, and explainable, we enable a new standard of trust for Metis, Hyperion, and all of Web3.\nHow is RugRadar different from CertiK and DeFiSafety and other smart contract analyzer tools?\nRugRadar is fully open source and on-chain. Unlike CertiK and DeFiSafety, our scoring logic and reports are public, auditable, and can\u2019t be bought or changed behind closed doors. The model adapts through real community feedback, not just by a private team, and RugRadar will also learn how to analyze off-chain risks and social patterns, not just code.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nAnyone can submit a new project or token for review. All scoring actions require a Hyperion wallet, instantly onboarding new users to the Metis L2.\nUsers can leave feedback on scores, suggest changes, and flag errors\nSimple leaderboard for most active reviewers and contributors\nEach helpful action earns XP points (for leaderboard, beta rewards, or future airdrops)\nEarly contributors can earn NFT badges and get first access to advanced tools\nRegular \u201cSpot the Rug\u201d campaigns to test and improve the agent with real cases\nFeedback and community data directly help train and improve the AI, making RugRadar smarter for everyone\nWhy us?\nOur team brings years of experience in evaluating and supporting hundreds of Web3 projects through AlphaMind.co - a launchpad & web3 project discovery platform, and InnMind.com - the leading acceleration platform for early-stage web3 projects.\nWe\u2019ve seen thousands of projects, analyzed hundreds and launched dozens. We have insights into common scam tactics and real-world due diligence from both VC and retail perspective, that will directly shape RugRadar\u2019s AI scoring logic. We\u2019re not just theorists: we\u2019re launchpad builders who know the pain points from both sides.\nWithin 3 months, we plan to launch a beta on Hyperion testnet, integrate community feedback, and be ready for mainnet when Hyperion goes live.\nCommunity members can:\nJoin as testers: submit real token projects for scoring, review reports, and give feedback.\nSubmit project data or suspicious cases for AI review\nHelp curate and flag new scam patterns or contribute to the open-source rule library.\nPropose scoring rules or help us benchmark scam patterns\nAll code and scoring rules are open and auditable: fork it, run your own, or integrate it into other platforms.\nJoin ambassador program and help spread the word.\nWe\u2019d love your feedback! What risks matter most to you as a builder, investor, or user?\nComment below and help shape the next step in Web3 trust.",

RugRadar will be a flagship example of Hyperion\u2019s AI capabilities, proving that complex AI agents can run on-chain at L2 speeds and deliver value to the community.\nProject Description\nCore functionality: The agent ingests white-papers, GitHub commits, byte-code, tokenomics and social patterns, runs an LLM-driven rule-engine (Alith) plus anomaly heuristics, then mints a DAT-anchored report with a 0-100 risk score visible on chain & via UI/bot.\n\nRugRadar on Hyperion: process from project submission to on-chain report\nEach report is published as a DAT on Hyperion, so it\u2019s tamper-proof and easy to check by anyone.\nAutomated, explainable scoring: Real-time, explainable risk scores with transparent audit logs, viewable on-chain and through an intuitive UI.\nMulti-source intelligence: Integrates on-chain analytics, cross-references external data (e.g., audit reports, GitHub activity), and flags suspicious or non-transparent elements.\nCommunity signals: Allows user-submitted reviews, crowd-sourced data points, and historical feedback to improve the agent\u2019s accuracy.\nContinuous learning: The AI agent continuously updates its heuristics using feedback loops and on-chain data, improving detection over time.\nSimple web interface at launch, with a Telegram bot pilot for fast alerts and feedback (off-chain interaction, on-chain data access)\nTechnologies & Approach:\nAlith SDK: For natural language understanding, reasoning, and explainability.\nHyperion L2 infrastructure: For ultra-fast, low-cost inference and public data availability.\nDecentralized Attestation Technology (DAT): To anchor due diligence reports and scoring provenance.\nUI/UX layer: Web and Telegram bot for seamless investor access.\nWhy we believe in this idea?\nBecause the future of Web3 relies on open, community-owned, and transparent systems, not black-box ratings controlled by corporations or pay-to-play platforms. The Metis ecosystem, with Hyperion and LazAI, is designed specifically to break this paradigm.\nToday, most rating and due diligence platforms operate with closed-source, unverifiable models and monetise ratings by selling \u201ctop\u201d listings to startups, creating conflicts of interest and undermining trust.\nWe believe every investor and builder deserves a system where the rules, data, and scoring logic are public and auditable.\nBy training RugRadar on real launchpad data, publishing our agent and scoring logic as open source, and inviting the community to help shape the rules, we create not just a tool, but a living, evolving knowledge base for the entire ecosystem.\nThis approach fits perfectly with Metis\u2019 vision for decentralized, on-chain AI: one where you can always verify the logic behind every score, where collective wisdom improves the model, and where no one can buy a good rating behind closed doors.\nBy making due diligence radically transparent, crowd-powered, and explainable, we enable a new standard of trust for Metis, Hyperion, and all of Web3.\nHow is RugRadar different from CertiK and DeFiSafety and other smart contract analyzer tools?\nRugRadar is fully open source and on-chain. Unlike CertiK and DeFiSafety, our scoring logic and reports are public, auditable, and can\u2019t be bought or changed behind closed doors. The model adapts through real community feedback, not just by a private team, and RugRadar will also learn how to analyze off-chain risks and social patterns, not just code.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nAnyone can submit a new project or token for review. All scoring actions require a Hyperion wallet, instantly onboarding new users to the Metis L2.\nUsers can leave feedback on scores, suggest changes, and flag errors\nSimple leaderboard for most active reviewers and contributors\nEach helpful action earns XP points (for leaderboard, beta rewards, or future airdrops)\nEarly contributors can earn NFT badges and get first access to advanced tools\nRegular \u201cSpot the Rug\u201d campaigns to test and improve the agent with real cases\nFeedback and community data directly help train and improve the AI, making RugRadar smarter for everyone\nWhy us?\nOur team brings years of experience in evaluating and supporting hundreds of Web3 projects through AlphaMind.co - a launchpad & web3 project discovery platform, and InnMind.com - the leading acceleration platform for early-stage web3 projects.\nWe\u2019ve seen thousands of projects, analyzed hundreds and launched dozens. We have insights into common scam tactics and real-world due diligence from both VC and retail perspective, that will directly shape RugRadar\u2019s AI scoring logic. We\u2019re not just theorists: we\u2019re launchpad builders who know the pain points from both sides.\nWithin 3 months, we plan to launch a beta on Hyperion testnet, integrate community feedback, and be ready for mainnet when Hyperion goes live.\nCommunity members can:\nJoin as testers: submit real token projects for scoring, review reports, and give feedback.\nSubmit project data or suspicious cases for AI review\nHelp curate and flag new scam patterns or contribute to the open-source rule library.\nPropose scoring rules or help us benchmark scam patterns\nAll code and scoring rules are open and auditable: fork it, run your own, or integrate it into other platforms.\nJoin ambassador program and help spread the word.\nWe\u2019d love your feedback! What risks matter most to you as a builder, investor, or user?\nComment below and help shape the next step in Web3 trust."

How is community feedback weighted in comparison to AI scoring?\nCommunity input is a big part of RugRadar\u2019s vision. At first, AI will do the scoring, but all feedback (votes/comments/flags) gets logged next to the score, in public.\nFYI, here\u2019s an example of the flow (short version):\nUser connects wallet \u2192 submits or reviews project \u2192 sees AI risk score \u2192 upvotes/downvotes or comments \u2192 feedback instantly shown next to score \u2192 flagged projects or major disagreements trigger manual/model review \u2192 all data stays public and auditable.\nOver time, the agent will learn from this data: if enough reputable users disagree with an AI score, it triggers a review or model adjustment. In the future, we\u2019re planning to experiment with reputation-weighted feedback, so trusted users\u2019 input has more impact on the model.\n2. Can RugRadar scores be integrated into launchpads or DeFi protocols for auto-blocklisting or smart contract warnings?\nOh yes, absolutely! One of our goals is to make RugRadar\u2019s scores available as a public API and on-chain DATs, so any launchpad or DeFi protocol and other platforms can integrate them. That means you could, for example, automatically flag or even block risky tokens before they go live, or trigger warnings in wallets, explorers, or DEXs.\nThe big idea is that RugRadar could become the go-to early warning tool for all kinds of crypto projects, for both retail users, ecosystems and builders!"

This is something we think about a lot.\nFor MVP, we\u2019ll have some basic protections:\nOne vote per wallet, anti-spam rate limits\nWe flag feedback from new or inactive wallets\nCommunity feedback is always public and transparent\nAs RugRadar grows, we\u2019ll add reputation: users who qualify certain criteria (give useful feedback, have certain onchain history and aren\u2019t bots) will have more weight.\nWe\u2019re also planning manual moderation and review if a project gets a suspicious wave of votes.\nBottom line: feedback is important, but it won\u2019t override AI scoring unless it comes from trusted, active users, and all actions are on-chain and auditable.\nOpen to ideas from the community on how to make this protection from manipulations even stronger"

You might need some dynamic elements that keep evolving so scammers can\u2019t just reverse engineer a \u201csafe\u201d score.\nCommunity feedback in crypto is also tricky. People have bags and tribal loyalties that mess with objective reviews. Might want to weight feedback based on track record or require some skin in the game.\nThe real challenge isn\u2019t just transparency, it\u2019s making gaming the system cost more (and less desirable) than actually building something legit. This is very similar to what I\u2019ve been thinking through in the setup of this forum. Curious how you\u2019ll handle it!"

Bad actors will study your algorithm and figure out how to game it.\nYeah, open sourcing has pros and cons. On one hand, transparency is a must if we want trust. On the other, it makes it easier for bad actors to \u201cgame\u201d the system. We actually discussed this risk with CTO when brainstorming for this application. We\u2019re planning to keep some dynamic, evolving heuristics (and maybe even a few \u201chidden\u201d flags) so it\u2019s not 100% predictable, and to keep updating as the landscape shifts.\ndaryl:\nCommunity feedback in crypto is also tricky. People have bags and tribal loyalties that mess with objective reviews.\nTotally agree about community feedback too. Especially when it comes to KOLs or influential community members, who often have \u201creputation risk\u201d. And in general in crypto, everyone has bags or their own tribe, so pure democracy isn\u2019t enough. We\u2019re thinking about a \u201creputation\u201d layer for feedback and might require some real skin in the game (stakes, history, on-chain activity) for the most impactful votes.\nEnd of the day, you nailed it: the hard part is making it easier to be legit than to fake it! That\u2019s what we\u2019re aiming for, would love any ideas or lessons you\u2019ve seen work (or even not work) in your own experience.\nThanks for challenging us to think sharper!"

But when you\u2019re months (or years) into a project, those words either become your daily practice \u2014 or they disappear into silence.\nHere\u2019s what trust has looked like in my operations:\nOwning delays publicly, not hiding them in silence.\nAdmitting when something didn\u2019t work, and asking the community to help shape what comes next.\nStaying visible, even when there\u2019s no hype left.\nNot pretending to be \u201cbuilding\u201d when you\u2019re really just buying time.\nIn Web3, where people have every reason to be skeptical, showing up consistently and honestly is the only way to build something sustainable.\nPeople don\u2019t just follow roadmaps, they follow integrity.\nAnd here\u2019s the unexpected part:\nWhen I started treating trust like part of the operational framework \u2014 not just a value, people didn\u2019t leave during tough moments. They leaned in. Offered support. Shared feedback. Stayed.\nIf you\u2019re an operator reading this:\nDon\u2019t wait for things to break before you bring the community in.\nDon\u2019t polish every update, speak like a human.\nDon\u2019t market trust. Practice it.\nHappy to dive deeper if anyone\u2019s interested in examples or real stories. Feel free to comment and share your experience\nLet\u2019s keep this space honest and operating."

                "comment": "So, I agree with this, AND, in practice it\u2019s really hard to do. When something breaks, and it\u2019s your fault (and that happens with EVERY project, or you\u2019re moving too slow) it\u2019s really tempting to keep it quiet. What makes it harder is that sometimes that\u2019s actually better - eg to try to fix it and show progress (or a solution) before going public about it.\nHow do you think about the in-the-moment decisions for this? Or, is this actually just black and white: own it publicly, build in public, 100% of the time, period?"

                "comment": "Great question, and I appreciate the honesty in your response.\nI get the instinct to wait until there\u2019s a fix before going public. But in my view, decentralization is about shared ownership, and that includes being upfront when something major goes wrong.\nYou don\u2019t have to share every small mistake, but when an issue affects the whole project or community, being transparent can actually build trust, not break it. It shows respect and invites collaboration.\nSo no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s black and white, but I do lean toward openness, especially when trust is on the line. I believe that solving problems with the help of community often leads to stronger, more sustainable relationships."

But with perpetuals, managing risk is key. How does the AI-powered alert system work in real-time during volatile market conditions?\nCan users customize these alerts based on their risk appetite (e.g., liquidation thresholds or price movements), and are there safeguards in place to avoid spammy or overly sensitive notifications?"

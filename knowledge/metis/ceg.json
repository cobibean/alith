        "content": "How LazAI is Building the Value Layer for AI Commerce\nOverview\nThe agent economy is emerging rapidly \u2014 autonomous agents now compose data, models, and APIs to perform complex tasks with minimal human input. Yet a fundamental issue persists: how value flows between the contributors who make these interactions possible.\nWhen an AI agent aggregates datasets, runs models, or calls APIs, it generates value, but the payment infrastructure doesn\u2019t recognize who contributed to that outcome. Traditional systems settle the transaction but ignore attribution. LazAI was designed to fix this.\nLazAI introduces a Web3-native AI infrastructure protocol that embeds ownership, rights, and value flow directly into the computation layer. It transforms how AI services are built, used, and paid for \u2014 creating a verifiable foundation for agent-to-agent commerce.\nThe Attribution Problem in AI\nAI agents don\u2019t operate in isolation. A single inference call might depend on:\nPublic datasets labeled by researchers.\nProprietary model weights hosted on another platform.\nCurated indexes or benchmark datasets maintained by a third party.\nEach of these assets has intrinsic value. Yet when the agent completes a task worth, say, $0.23, the payment system only rewards the API endpoint or model host. The people who built the data pipelines or validated the benchmarks receive nothing.\nThis lack of attribution discourages collaboration, stifles open contribution, and creates perverse incentives for closed AI systems. LazAI changes that by making attribution a protocol-level primitive, not an afterthought.\nThe LazAI Architecture\nLazAI\u2019s architecture connects data provenance, usage rights, and automated value distribution into one continuous flow.\n1. Data Anchoring Token (DAT)\nAt the core is the Data Anchoring Token (DAT) \u2014 a tokenized record of contribution. A DAT represents any AI asset that contributes to computation: datasets, fine-tuned models, prompt libraries, or evaluation pipelines.\nEach DAT contains three essential components:\nProvenance \u2013 The origin, lineage, and versioning of the asset.\nRights \u2013 The permitted use cases and geographic or commercial restrictions.\nRevenue \u2013 The rules for how contributors are compensated (flat fees, percentages, or dynamic splits).\nWhen an AI agent uses an asset registered as a DAT, LazAI records the dependency and triggers payment distribution automatically. This is not a DRM system \u2014 assets remain open, but usage is logged on-chain, allowing transparent, permissionless monetization.\n2. Integration with x402 Protocol\nLazAI integrates x402, the new payment protocol based on the HTTP 402 \u201cPayment Required\u201d status code. Revived by Coinbase and Cloudflare, x402 lets servers and agents exchange micropayments directly over standard web requests \u2014 no logins, OAuth, or centralized billing.\nThe server issues an HTTP 402 challenge: \u201cThis request costs $0.40.\u201d\nThe agent signs a payment on-chain (often in stablecoins or BTC) and resubmits proof.\nOnce verified, the resource is served immediately.\nWhile x402 standardizes how payments occur, LazAI defines who gets paid and how much.\nIt extends x402 with in-band settlement logic, using DAT metadata to calculate and execute revenue splits in real time.\nExample Flow:\nA diagnostic model API costs $0.40 per call.\nThe model references three upstream assets via DATs \u2014 a dataset, segmentation library, and benchmark suite.\nWhen payment clears, LazAI automatically splits the $0.40 among all contributors per their DAT-defined terms.\nAll activity is cryptographically verifiable on-chain.\n3. Verifiable Computing Framework\nEvery LazAI transaction runs through a verifiable computing framework, combining Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to ensure execution integrity.\nThis architecture guarantees that:\nThe computation was executed as declared.\nThe dependency tree and payment splits match the declared DATs.\nContributors can audit their earnings independently.\nThis creates a trust-minimized execution environment for multi-party AI collaboration.\nThe Multi-Chain Settlement Infrastructure\nLazAI\u2019s infrastructure extends beyond a single network, leveraging three specialized layers for scalability and composability:\nMetis (Settlement and Execution Layers)\nHyperion \u2013 A high-throughput rollup optimized for AI and real-time workloads. It executes agentic transactions efficiently while supporting dynamic payment flows.\nAndromeda \u2013 The decentralized settlement layer, anchoring final results and balances for auditability.\nTogether, Metis provides both speed and verifiable finality for LazAI\u2019s x402 payments.\nGOAT Network (Bitcoin Integration)\nGOAT enables Bitcoin-native agentic commerce. Through zkRollups and EIP-3009 support, it allows ultra-low-cost, near-instant settlements in BTC \u2014 extending x402 payments beyond stablecoins and into Bitcoin-based ecosystems.\nZKM (Zero-Knowledge Machine)\nZKM introduces a trust-minimized facilitator that proves each x402 interaction is valid. Rather than requiring trust in intermediaries, proofs make every payment, dependency validation, and rights check publicly verifiable.\nHow LazAI Changes the Payment Model\nMost AI platforms operate on centralized billing cycles: one payment to the API host, then manual distribution off-chain. LazAI replaces this with atomic, on-chain value flow:\nRegister Asset: A contributor mints a DAT for their dataset, model, or benchmark.\nDeclare Terms: The DAT defines provenance, rights, and revenue structure.\nExecute Call: An agent interacts with an x402-enabled API.\nCompute Split: LazAI\u2019s contracts read dependency metadata and allocate payments automatically.\nSettle Cross-Chain: Funds are routed to each contributor\u2019s preferred chain and asset.\nThis eliminates the need for invoices, accounting, or delayed reconciliation. Payment and attribution are part of the same protocol call.\nWhy It Matters\nWithout attribution, AI economies replicate the same inequality as the Web2 attention economy \u2014 centralized platforms capture most of the value while creators get nothing.\nLazAI reverses that model. By embedding attribution, ownership, and payments at the protocol level, it ensures that every participant \u2014 from dataset curators to model hosts \u2014 is compensated fairly, transparently, and instantly.\nThis is how LazAI, powered by Metis, GOAT, and ZKM, turns x402 from a payment status code into a real market infrastructure for agent-to-agent commerce.\nWhat\u2019s Next\nThe next phase is operationalizing this stack for public use. LazAI\u2019s value layer will allow developers, data scientists, and model builders to earn directly from AI adoption \u2014 without relying on enterprise gatekeepers.\nLazAI doesn\u2019t just make AI payments possible; it makes them provable, composable, and fair.\nIf you\u2019re building AI infrastructure, data products, or autonomous agents, the LazAI ecosystem invites you to contribute \u2014 and earn \u2014 in the new value layer of AI commerce.",

By embedding attribution, ownership, and payments at the protocol level, it ensures that every participant \u2014 from dataset curators to model hosts \u2014 is compensated fairly, transparently, and instantly.\nThis is how LazAI, powered by Metis, GOAT, and ZKM, turns x402 from a payment status code into a real market infrastructure for agent-to-agent commerce.\nWhat\u2019s Next\nThe next phase is operationalizing this stack for public use. LazAI\u2019s value layer will allow developers, data scientists, and model builders to earn directly from AI adoption \u2014 without relying on enterprise gatekeepers.\nLazAI doesn\u2019t just make AI payments possible; it makes them provable, composable, and fair.\nIf you\u2019re building AI infrastructure, data products, or autonomous agents, the LazAI ecosystem invites you to contribute \u2014 and earn \u2014 in the new value layer of AI commerce."

        "content": "Abstract\nThis proposal advances Metis\u2019 next phase of ecosystem alignment - strengthening the bridge across all network layers (Andromeda, Hyperion, LazAI, ZKM, GOAT) through refined token flows and unified incentives that reward real usage. It formalizes two interlinked upgrades:\nOptimizing DSeq sustainability (20% \u2192 15%) and establishing the Ecosystem Alignment & Growth Reserve (EAGR) to power validator expansion, liquidity depth, and cross-layer participation - without new issuance or inflation.\nBackground\nCurrent State\nSince ReGenesis, Metis has operated on a consistent architectural principle: fortify the base infrastructure first, enable high-performance applications, and ensure that generated value flows back to the ecosystem. As outlined in Elena\u2019s recent letter to the community ( Metis September Monthly Roundup: Hyperion Builders Make History - Metis ), our architecture includes:\nAndromeda: Traditional EVM-compatible Layer 2 handling general settlement and foundational applications, including DeFi\nHyperion: Performance expansion layer providing elasticity for high-throughput, low-latency scenarios, including AI workloads\nLazAI: Application and data layer converting AI \u00d7 DAT scenarios into on-chain visible records that connect user actions with assetization paths\nZKM: Zero-knowledge and verifiable compute infrastructure as long-term primitives\nGOAT: Bitcoin Layer 2 exploration derived from ZKM, philosophically aligned with Metis in turning verifiable compute and real usage into network value\nThese components represent different facets of a unified ecosystem in which network value returns to the Metis ecosystem through usage-driven, on-chain-visible mechanisms.\nUnifying the Metis Ecosystem\nThe blockchain industry has seen major shifts lately. Market volatility has tested Layer 2 ecosystems, while AI\u2019s rise has created new opportunities and pressures for infrastructure builders. Communities have voiced concerns about sustainability, resource efficiency, and the need for adaptive strategies that stay true to core principles.\nMetis\u2019 approach focuses on strategic alignment rather than reactive change, bringing the other network layers into closer alignment. Its integration of AI through LazAI and verifiable compute via ZKM reflects a long-term vision of usage-driven value creation\u2014not short-term trend chasing. To realize this, Metis is refining its economic model to balance immediate incentives with long-term sustainability as it launches new network phases requiring validator and liquidity support.\nProposal Details\nA key component of ecosystem unification is establishing METIS as the native gas token for the LazAI network. This represents the first step in unifying the ecosystem, creating direct, usage-driven demand in which every AI inference, data operation, and on-chain computation requires METIS. The EAGR will provide initial gas liquidity support and mechanisms to ensure a seamless user experience during network launch.\nThe two interconnected optimizations proposed below enable this ecosystem unification while maintaining long-term sustainability:\n1. Decentralized Sequencer Mining Rewards Optimization\nCurrent Parameter: 20% annualized mining rewards rate\nProposed Parameter: 15% annualized mining rewards rate\nRationale:\nThe Decentralized Sequencer pool has matured since launch, with established participation and operational stability\nAt 15%, Metis sequencer yields remain above leading L2 averages (e.g., Base, Arbitrum validator returns <10%), ensuring continued attractiveness while improving economic runway by 25%.\nOptimizing the rate frees capital for broader ecosystem expansion and aligns incentives across upcoming network layers.\nImplementation:\nSmooth phased rollout to ensure continuity\nParameters and timeline will be determined to minimize disruption and adjusted as needed\nExisting sequencer operations remain unaffected during the transition period\n2. Establishment of Ecosystem Alignment & Growth Reserve (EAGR)\nSize: 20% of total METIS supply (reallocated from existing Mining Rewards).\nSource: Reallocation within the original tokenomics \u201cMining Rewards\u201d toward growth\nCritical Clarifications:\nNo new token issuance: EAGR represents a reallocation toward growth of already-allocated tokens\nNo change to total supply cap: The maximum METIS supply remains unchanged\nPhased release model: Tokens convert to circulating supply gradually per specific use case activation\nCommunity & Stakeholder Participation Paths & EAGR Example Use Cases (Whitelist-Based Execution):\nValidator Staking for New Network Phases\nEcosystem Liquidity Support\nTreasury Support for Ecosystem Sub-Projects\nGovernance and Execution:\nPhased release per use-case activation\nWhitelist-based allocation requiring documented usage justification\nImplementation aligned with established governance procedures\nEconomic Impact Analysis:\nTotal supply: 10,000,000 METIS \u2192 10,000,000 METIS (No change)\nCirculating Supply: Dynamic \u2192 Dynamic (Phased per use case)\nDemand-side offsets: Staking, locking, and real usage requirements create natural demand mechanisms\nInflation: None\nBenefits to the Metis Ecosystem\nFor METIS Holders:\nImproved long-term economic sustainability through balanced reward structures\nEnhanced ecosystem growth potential through strategic capital allocation\nTransparent resource management with clear accountability mechanisms\nFor Decentralized Sequencers:\nContinued competitive rewards at a 15% annualized rate\nSmooth transition, preventing operational disruption\nStrengthened overall ecosystem supporting sequencer value proposition\nFor Ecosystem Builders:\nAccess to strategic support through EAGR mechanisms for qualified projects\nValidator participation opportunities in emerging network phases\nAligned incentive structures promoting long-term ecosystem contribution\nFor the Broader Community:\nVisible commitment to sustainable growth over short-term extraction\nInfrastructure support for next-generation applications (AI, DAT, cross-chain)\nModel resilience during market volatility\nImplementation Roadmap\nPhase 1 (Upon Approval): Governance vote completion and result announcement\nPhase 2 (Within 2 weeks of approval):\nDetailed technical implementation notice for DSeq rate transition\nEAGR establishment\nPhase 3 (Within 4 weeks of approval):\nDSeq rate smooth transition initiation\nPhase 4 (Ongoing):\nValidator participation program details release\nCommunity feedback integration\nAdaptive parameter adjustments through governance as needed\nVoting Details\nProposal Type: Governance Proposal (modifies economic model parameters and tokenomics structure)\nVoting Platform: Snapshot (https://snapshot.org/#/metislayer2.eth)\nVoting Link: Governance Proposal: Metis Ecosystem Unification and Economic Model Evolution\nVoting Timeline:\nMonday, October 27: Proposal publication on governance forum, accompanying blog post announcement, and Snapshot vote initiation\nWednesday, October 29: Snapshot vote initiation\nThursday, October 30: Community Twitter Space for questions and clarifications\nMonday, November 3: Vote conclusion (5-day voting period)\nVoting Options:\nApprove (support both DSeq rate optimization and EAGR establishment)\nReject (oppose the proposed changes)\nAbstain\nQuorum Requirements: Per the governance framework for Governance Proposals\nImplementation Authority: Upon majority approval, the Metis Foundation will coordinate execution under guidance from community governance and validator feedback according to established governance procedures, with Governance Working Group oversight.\nOfficial Links\nMetis Foundation Governance Framework: Metis Foundation - Governance\nMetis Developer Documentation: https://docs.metis.io\nDecentralized Sequencer Overview: https://docs.metis.io/dev/decentralized-sequencer/overview\nCEG Governance Forum: https://forum.ceg.vote\nSnapshot Voting Platform: https://snapshot.org/#/metislayer2.eth\nDisclaimer\nThrough this proposal, Metis affirms its belief that resilience is built, not bought.

They write up what they learned, post tutorials, or share their story so someone else can take that knowledge and run with it.\nHere\u2019s what being a Dev Ambassador actually looks like:\nRoll up your sleeves and contribute to building features, improve open-source, and dive into real-world projects.\nTeach what you know, write tutorials, share technical articles, and create resources based on your own experience.\nStay active on GitHub, commit code, squash bugs, share cool tools, or kick off a new project.\nShare your process, write blogs, or make videos about what you\u2019ve actually built, not just what caught your eye.\nGet involved in run sessions, answer questions, mentor folks, and help the community level up.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, posting is part of the job.

This helps researchers get faster, more comprehensive, and less biased feedback, leading to higher quality publications.\nHow Alith SDK or DATs Make it Possible:\nMulti-Agent System: A \u201cPeer Review Orchestrator\u201d agent could assign sections of a paper to various specialized AI agents (e.g., \u201cStatistical Analyst Agent,\u201d \u201cMethodology Validator Agent,\u201d \u201cCode Reproducibility Agent\u201d).

Reviewer agents could \u201cbid\u201d for review tasks on a DAT Marketplace, earning reputation tokens or cryptocurrency for accurate and insightful reviews.

There\u2019s a risk of \u201csuperficial\u201d reviews if not carefully designed. Handling highly novel or interdisciplinary research might be challenging.\nFuture Improvements: Incorporate human-in-the-loop validation where human experts review the AI agents\u2019 findings. Develop more sophisticated AI agents capable of understanding context and identifying groundbreaking ideas. Integrate reputation systems that penalize agents for consistently providing poor or misleading reviews.\nUse Case 2: AI-Powered \u201cBug Bounty\u201d for Smart Contract Auditing\nThe Idea and Who it Helps: Smart contracts are prone to vulnerabilities, leading to massive financial losses. This system would create an autonomous bug bounty program where specialized AI auditing agents continuously scan smart contracts for exploits. It helps blockchain developers deploy more secure contracts and incentivizes AI security researchers.\nHow Alith SDK or DATs Make it Possible:\nMulti-Agent System: A \u201cSecurity Audit Orchestrator\u201d agent would manage a pool of various \u201cVulnerability Detection Agents\u201d (e.g., agents specializing in reentrancy attacks, front-running, gas limit exploits, access control issues). The orchestrator could distribute new smart contract code (as DATs) to these agents for analysis.\nDAT Marketplaces: Smart contract developers could publish their contract code as a DAT on a \u201cBug Bounty Marketplace.\u201d AI auditing agents would compete to find vulnerabilities. When an agent identifies a bug, it submits a \u201cproof-of-vulnerability\u201d DAT. If verified, the agent receives a bounty (e.g., in a native token or cryptocurrency) from the developer or a dedicated fund.\nAlith SDK: The SDK would enable secure submission of contract code, verifiable reporting of vulnerabilities, and automated payout of bounties upon successful verification, all recorded on-chain.\nLimitations or Future Improvements:\nLimitations: AI agents might struggle with novel attack vectors or highly complex contract logic. False positives could be an issue, requiring careful design of verification mechanisms.\nFuture Improvements: Integrate formal verification methods with AI analysis to reduce false positives. Develop \u201cexploit generation agents\u201d that can not only identify vulnerabilities but also demonstrate practical exploits. Create a feedback loop where successful exploit data is used to train and improve future auditing agents.\nUse Case 3: Collaborative Drug Discovery and Validation\nThe Idea and Who it Helps: Accelerate drug discovery by having various AI agents collaboratively explore chemical spaces, predict drug efficacy, and even simulate drug interactions and toxicity. This benefits pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, and ultimately, patients.\nHow Alith SDK or DATs Make it Possible:\nMulti-Agent System: A \u201cDrug Discovery Orchestrator\u201d agent could coordinate \u201cMolecule Generation Agents,\u201d \u201cEfficacy Prediction Agents,\u201d \u201cToxicity Simulation Agents,\u201d and \u201cClinical Trial Design Agents.\u201d Each agent contributes its specialized knowledge to the overall discovery pipeline.\nDAT Marketplaces: Researchers could contribute proprietary datasets (e.g., chemical libraries, patient data, clinical trial results) as encrypted DATs on a \u201cBiopharma Data Marketplace.\u201d AI agents requiring specific data for their tasks could access these DATs under predefined, verifiable access conditions, paying data providers for usage. Synthesized drug candidates and their predicted properties could also be published as DATs.\nAlith SDK: The SDK would manage secure, permissioned access to sensitive biomedical DATs, ensure verifiable execution of AI agent tasks, and enable transparent sharing of research outcomes and intellectual property.\nLimitations or Future Improvements:\nLimitations: The complexity of biological systems makes accurate AI prediction challenging. Ethical considerations around data privacy (especially patient data) are paramount.\nFuture Improvements: Implement federated learning approaches to train agents on decentralized datasets without directly exposing raw data. Develop \u201cexplainable AI\u201d (XAI) agents to provide transparency into drug predictions, building trust with human researchers. Integrate wet-lab robotic systems for automated physical validation of promising drug candidates identified by the agents.\n@LazAI",

Now imagine these vulnerabilities not in a closed API, but running directly on-chain where logic is permanent, transparent, and potentially high-stakes.\nThis raises the question: How do we prevent on-chain AI from being manipulated, abused, or exploited by malicious actors?\nHere are a few areas I think we need to explore as a community:\nPrompt Validation and Sanitization\nBefore any prompt reaches an on-chain LLM, there needs to be strict filtering, formatting, and intent verification. Just like how we validate transaction inputs, we may need decentralized prompt parsers that reject malformed or dangerous instructions.\nOn-Chain Prompt Reputation\nWe could design a system where prompts (or prompt creators) build a reputation score based on past behavior. If a user or dApp continuously submits prompts that lead to risky or abnormal outputs, their reputation could drop, and access could be limited or flagged.\nRule-Constrained Models\nOne way to reduce risk is to fine-tune LLMs with hard-coded boundaries. For example, an LLM powering a finance protocol should never generate prompts that execute transfers, change fees, or touch treasury funds unless additional authorization layers are triggered.\nSandboxed Execution for Agents\nLLM-based agents could operate within a strict sandbox where they cannot execute arbitrary contract calls. Their responses would be suggestions, which must pass through a verification layer or human approval before actual execution.\nAI-Specific Auditing Tools\nJust as we audit smart contracts with tools like MythX or Slither, we\u2019ll likely need new tools to simulate how LLMs respond to a wide range of inputs, including edge cases and adversarial examples. These tools would help identify vulnerabilities before deployment.\nThis is a new layer of risk for the blockchain space.

        "content": "Project Name\nCERTHUB (Digital Certification Hub): Decentralized Educational, Formal and Informal Credentials\nProblem Statement\nIn today\u2019s digital world, credential fraud costs the global economy over $30 billion annually, with 1 in 3 job applicants falsifying qualifications.\nTraditional educational certificates are prone to fraud, clones,inaccessibility, with 20-30% of resumes containing falsified credentials and verification processes often taking a long time due to centralized manual systems.\nStudents, especially in underserved regions, struggle to access or share verifiable credentials, while institutions face high administrative costs and risks of data breaches and manipulation. This creates distrust, delays, and inequities in education and employment opportunities.\nSolution Overview\nCERTHUB is a blockchain-based platform for issuing, claiming, and verifying educational certificates as ERC1155 NFTs, ensuring tamper-proof, globally accessible credentials.\nUsing a factory contract to deploy gas-efficient proxy contracts of each certificate per institution, institutions can issue digital certificates, students can claim them via a mode of a merkle proof verified on-chain, and employers can verify them instantly on-chain via the platform.\nOur approach is innovative due to its scalability, use of Merkle proofs for eligibility, and IPFS for decentralized metadata that contains descriptive details about what a certificate is representing and a web link pointing to the exact platform issuing the certificate, addressing fraud, inefficiency, and access barriers. Any certificate issued on this platform by any insitution can assured its global legitimacy.\nProject Description\nCERTHUB revolutionizes educational credentialing by enabling clients (institutions or any organization), to issue certificates as ERC1155 non-fungible tokens on the blockchain, with each certificate type managed by a proxy contract deployed via a call to the certificate factory contract (EducationalCertificateFactory). The registration and verification of legitimacy of these institutions and organizations that come to create a certificate will be done by the use of an AI Agent so avoid forgery and plagiarism of these instutions data by an external actor.\nUpon successful verification of these clients, the Core features will include:\nIssuance: Institutions deploy proxy contracts to mint tokens to the institutions wallet address, paste a list of addresses to the frontend, which will be hashed by the application to generate a merkle root and sent to the smart contract and root and proofs file will also will be automatically downloaded for the issuer to send to students via an external confidential link. The URI-metadata link (e.g., { \"name\": \"Bachelor of Science 2025\" }) stored on IPFS via a pinning platform, can be sent to the smart contract also. A new certificate of the same type can be re-issued or updated by the institution at a ny chosen interval.\nClaiming: Students can come to input details (e.g., institution, certificate name, year) and their respective Merkle proofs that was generated by the application and sent to them by respective institutions , to claim their respective tokens to their wallets. This triggers a transfer of a token from the institutions address to their wallet upon successful verification of merkle proof by the smart contract and these tokens can only be claimed once by the receipient.\nVerification: A verifyCertificate function will allow instant, trustless credential checks by employers or any third party to check the legitimacy of the certificate claim by the receipint on the platform.\nScalability: With each certificate deployment by an institution standing as an Independent token on-chain ,enabling for wallet and block-explorer\u2019s recognition of the token name, the EIP-1167 minimal proxies will be used to reduce deployment costs by ~90% compared to full contracts.\nTechnologies include Solidity for smart contracts, IPFS for metadata storage by the Clients, and React for the frontend, with potential integration of The Graph for off-chain indexing. Students interact via a web interface, entering certificate details to claim tokens displayed in respective wallets (e.g MetaMask), while employers query the blockchain for verification. We\u2019re excited about CERTHUB\u2019s potential to eliminate fraud, streamline global hiring, and empower students in underserved regions with permanent, verifiable credentials, creating a new standard for trust in education.\n1.Question: How could AI be integrated beyond institution verification - could CERTHUB leverage Hyperion\u2019s AI co-agent or Alith to enhance certificate validation, metadata generation, or fraud detection mechanisms?\nResponse:\nCERTHUB can extend AI integration beyond institution verification by leveraging Hyperion\u2019s AI co-agent Alith to enhance certificate validation, metadata generation, and fraud detection, aligning with the Alith Integration Bonus Track and AI-Native Track. Here\u2019s how:\na) Input Parsing: For example Alith can help read through a spread sheet of names and addresses containing valid students that should be able to come and claim a certificate, uploaded by an institution and help automatically extract valid wallet addresses in the spreadsheet and send them to the smart contract for a merkle root and proofs hashing.\nb) Certificate Validation:\nAlith Integration: Use Alith to perform real-time, on-chain analysis of certificate claims. Alith can cross-reference student data against external datasets (e.g.look up the name and wallet address in the former uploaded spreadsheet and cross check with the input given by the receipient, to verify eligibility before claimCertificate is executed. This reduces reliance on Merkle proofs alone, adding a dynamic validation and double factor authentication layer.\nc) Integration with META-DATA: Leverage Alith to auto-generate IPFS metadata JSON for certificates. Alith can process institution inputs (e.g., certificate description to create standardized SEO-friendly metadata with attributes like name, image, and external_url.\nImplementation: A frontend button triggers Alith to generate metadata (e.g., { \u201cname\u201d: \u201cBachelor of Science 2025\u201d, \u201cexternal_url\u201d: \u201chttps://mit.edu/certificates/MIT-BS-2025\u201d }), upload it to Pinning platform, and return the CID to the contract.\nBenefit: Saves institutions time, ensures consistent metadata (critical for wallet display), and supports scalability for thousands of certificates.\nd) Fraud Detection:\nDeploy Alith as an on-chain fraud detection agent, analyzing transaction patterns (e.g., multiple claims from one address, unusual verification requests) to flag suspicious activity.\nReal-Time Features and Hyperion\u2019s Minimal Latency\nQuestion: What real-time features does CERTHUB implement for certificate issuance, claiming, and verification processes, and how could Hyperion\u2019s minimal latency infrastructure improve user experience during high-volume periods?\nResponse:\nCERTHUB will implement real-time features for issuance, claiming, and verification with aid of leveraging Hyperion\u2019s minimal latency infrastructure to ensure a seamless user experience especially during high-volume periods (e.g., graduation season). This aligns with the Real-Time Systems Track.\nCurrent Real-Time Features:\nIssuance: Institutions deploy proxy contracts via EducationalCertificateFactory.createCertificate, generating Merkle roots and proofs in the frontend (IssueCertificate.jsx). The transaction confirms in ~1-2 seconds on Hyperion\u2019s testnet, minting tokens to the institution\u2019s wallet instantly.\nClaiming: Students claim tokens via claimCertificate, uploading Merkle proofs and triggering an on-chain transfer from the institution\u2019s wallet. The frontend polls transaction status, updating the UI in real-time (e.g., \u201cCertificate claimed!\u201d).\nVerification: The verifyCertificate function is a view call, returning isValid, studentName, and studentID instantly without gas costs, enabling employers to verify credentials in <1 second.\nHyperion\u2019s Minimal Latency Improvements:\nHigh-Volume Periods: Hyperion\u2019s ultra-fast Layer 2 blockchain ensures CERTHUB handles thousands of simultaneous claims/verifications during peak times (e.g., 10,000 students claiming degrees post-graduation).\nUser Experience: Reduced latency minimizes frontend loading times, critical for regions with unstable internet. For example, a student in a rural area can claim a certificate in ~1 second compared to a layer 1 blockchain.\nScalability: Hyperion\u2019s high throughput supports batch operations (e.g., minting over 10,000 > tokens in one transaction), reducing wait times for institutions issuing large certificate batches.\nFrontend Optimization: Use Hyperion\u2019s WebSocket provider in ethers.js for real-time transaction.\nSmart Contract Optimization for Hyperion and Metis SDK Interoperability\nQuestion: How will CERTHUB\u2019s smart contract architecture (particularly the ERC1155 implementation and proxy contracts) be optimized specifically for Hyperion, and are there plans to enhance interoperability using the Metis SDK?\nResponse:\nCERTHUB\u2019s ERC1155-based architecture, with factory-deployed proxy contracts will be optimized for Hyperion\u2019s ultra-fast Layer 2 blockchain and can possibly leverage the Metis SDK for interoperability, aligning with the Infrastructure Track and Interoperability with Metis SDK sub-track.\nHyperion Optimization:\nDeployment Efficiency: The EducationalCertificateImplementation will deploy ERC1155 proxy\u2019s , allowing multiple certificate types issuance at once with help of hyperion\u2019s A.I co-agent , reducing storage unlike native contract costs. Hyperion\u2019s low gas fees (~1/10th of Ethereum mainnet) make minting affordable.\nProxy Contracts: EIP-1167 minimal proxies reduce deployment costs by ~90% (100,000 gas vs. 1-2M), ideal for Hyperion\u2019s high-throughput environment where thousands of proxies can be deployed cheaply.\nGas Optimization:\nUse staticcall in verifyCertificate to eliminate gas costs for verifiers.\nBatch minting in createCertificateBatch minimizes transaction overhead.\nHyperion-Specific: Deploy on Hyperion testnet, using its WebSocket provider for real-time transaction confirmations, reducing claim/verification latency to <1 second.\nMetis SDK Interoperability:\nCross-Chain Verification: Use Metis SDK to bridge CERTHUB\u2019s credentials between Hyperion and Andromeda (Metis\u2019 mainnet). Employers on Andromeda can verify Hyperion-issued certificates via a bridge contract:\nCredentialBridge.sol\nMetis SDK Integration: Possibly Use Metis SDK\u2019s cross-chain messaging to sync CredentialRegistry data between Hyperion and Andromeda, enabling seamless verification across Metis ecosystems.\nFrontend Support: Add a \u201cBridge Credential\u201d button in ClaimCertificate.jsx to mirror credentials to Andromeda, enhancing portability for students.\nMonetization Strategy and Gas Efficiency\nQuestion: What is the project\u2019s monetization strategy and how will gas efficiency improvements on Hyperion impact the platform\u2019s economics and accessibility, particularly for underserved regions?\nResponse:\nCERTHUB\u2019s monetization strategy balances revenue with accessibility, leveraging Hyperion\u2019s gas efficiency to make credentialing affordable, especially for underserved regions, aligning with the Infrastructure Track for equitable tools.\nMonetization Strategy:\nInstitution Fees: Charge institutions a small fee for deploying proxies and minting tokens. Fees will be paid in METIS, leveraging Hyperion\u2019s low costs.\nPremium Features: Offer premium services, such as:\nAlith-powered analytics (e.g., fraud detection reports).\nCustom metadata designs (e.g., branded certificate images).\nIntegration with job platforms (e.g., LinkedIn) for seamless verification.\nVerification Subscriptions: Employers or platforms pay a subscription (e.g., $100/month) for unlimited verifyCredential calls via CredentialRegistry.\nGas Efficiency Impact:\nHyperion\u2019s Low Fees: Hyperion\u2019s gas costs are ~1/10th of Ethereum mainnet, reducing proxy deployment to ~$0.01 and token minting to ~$0.001 per certificate.\nEconomics: Institutions issuing 10,000 certificates pay ~$10 in gas (vs. ~$100 on Ethereum), lowering operational costs and enabling smaller institutions (e.g., community colleges in underserved regions) to adopt CERTHUB.\nAccessibility: Students in underserved regions (e.g., rural Africa) pay ~$0.001 to claim a certificate, affordable even on low-cost devices. Hyperion\u2019s high throughput ensures claims process instantly, critical for unstable internet connections.\nBatch Operations: Batch minting and claiming reduce gas by 50-70%, making CERTHUB viable for mass issuance (e.g., 1M certificates annually).\nHyperHack Prize Track and Technical Innovations\nQuestion: Which specific HyperHack prize track (AI-Native, Real-Time Systems, or Infrastructure) is CERTHUB best positioned to compete in, and what unique technical innovations make it a strong contender?\nResponse:\nCERTHUB is best positioned for the AI-Native and Core-Aligned Projects Track, with strong alignment to the Alith Integration Track and secondary fit for the Real-Time Systems Track.\nPrimary Track: AI-Native and Core-Aligned Projects:\nWhy: CERTHUB embeds AI at its core via Alith for institution verification, certificate validation, metadata generation, and fraud detection, meeting the \u201cAI-Native dApps\u201d and \u201cHyperion AI Integration\u201d sub-tracks.\nInnovations:\nAlith-Powered Verification: Real-time student data validation using Alith\u2019s on-chain AI pipelines, reducing fraud (1 in 3 falsified qualifications).\nAI Metadata Generation: Alith auto-generates IPFS metadata, ensuring wallet display (e.g., \u201cBachelor of Science 2025\u201d) and scalability.\nFraud Detection: Alith analyzes transaction patterns, emitting FraudDetected events to protect the financial detrement credential market.",

                "comment": "Project Name\nCERTHUB (Digital Certification Hub): Decentralized Educational, Formal and Informal Credentials\nProblem Statement\nIn today\u2019s digital world, credential fraud costs the global economy over $30 billion annually, with 1 in 3 job applicants falsifying qualifications.\nTraditional educational certificates are prone to fraud, clones,inaccessibility, with 20-30% of resumes containing falsified credentials and verification processes often taking a long time due to centralized manual systems.\nStudents, especially in underserved regions, struggle to access or share verifiable credentials, while institutions face high administrative costs and risks of data breaches and manipulation. This creates distrust, delays, and inequities in education and employment opportunities.\nSolution Overview\nCERTHUB is a blockchain-based platform for issuing, claiming, and verifying educational certificates as ERC1155 NFTs, ensuring tamper-proof, globally accessible credentials.\nUsing a factory contract to deploy gas-efficient proxy contracts of each certificate per institution, institutions can issue digital certificates, students can claim them via a mode of a merkle proof verified on-chain, and employers can verify them instantly on-chain via the platform.\nOur approach is innovative due to its scalability, use of Merkle proofs for eligibility, and IPFS for decentralized metadata that contains descriptive details about what a certificate is representing and a web link pointing to the exact platform issuing the certificate, addressing fraud, inefficiency, and access barriers. Any certificate issued on this platform by any insitution can assured its global legitimacy.\nProject Description\nCERTHUB revolutionizes educational credentialing by enabling clients (institutions or any organization), to issue certificates as ERC1155 non-fungible tokens on the blockchain, with each certificate type managed by a proxy contract deployed via a call to the certificate factory contract (EducationalCertificateFactory). The registration and verification of legitimacy of these institutions and organizations that come to create a certificate will be done by the use of an AI Agent so avoid forgery and plagiarism of these instutions data by an external actor.\nUpon successful verification of these clients, the Core features will include:\nIssuance: Institutions deploy proxy contracts to mint tokens to the institutions wallet address, paste a list of addresses to the frontend, which will be hashed by the application to generate a merkle root and sent to the smart contract and root and proofs file will also will be automatically downloaded for the issuer to send to students via an external confidential link. The URI-metadata link (e.g., { \"name\": \"Bachelor of Science 2025\" }) stored on IPFS via a pinning platform, can be sent to the smart contract also. A new certificate of the same type can be re-issued or updated by the institution at a ny chosen interval.\nClaiming: Students can come to input details (e.g., institution, certificate name, year) and their respective Merkle proofs that was generated by the application and sent to them by respective institutions , to claim their respective tokens to their wallets. This triggers a transfer of a token from the institutions address to their wallet upon successful verification of merkle proof by the smart contract and these tokens can only be claimed once by the receipient.\nVerification: A verifyCertificate function will allow instant, trustless credential checks by employers or any third party to check the legitimacy of the certificate claim by the receipint on the platform.\nScalability: With each certificate deployment by an institution standing as an Independent token on-chain ,enabling for wallet and block-explorer\u2019s recognition of the token name, the EIP-1167 minimal proxies will be used to reduce deployment costs by ~90% compared to full contracts.\nTechnologies include Solidity for smart contracts, IPFS for metadata storage by the Clients, and React for the frontend, with potential integration of The Graph for off-chain indexing. Students interact via a web interface, entering certificate details to claim tokens displayed in respective wallets (e.g MetaMask), while employers query the blockchain for verification.

Since Voyage Campaign was not only hosted by Metis, but also involved a third party provider (W3DV). Metis has been dealing with this for some time, so you just have to wait, as you know Metis team is focused on community development and rewarding real contributors and valuable users, and not bot farms and scripted activities. Nobody is squeezing the community you know.\nThe Metis team voluntarily supported and returned the money lost for using PolyNetwork. Isn\u2019t this a real example of a team that is extremely loyal to the community?"

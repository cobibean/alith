So many projects moved towards the airdrop strategy and didn\u2019t get a very high payback in terms of user retention after the airdrop season was over. There is even a part of the community that\u2019s called \u201cairdrop hunters\u201d. They come and go from one project to another. KOLs who promote such behaviour have very active audiences; some people even earn small fortunes on airdrops. If you think these people stay for the product or the project, you\u2019re mistaken. They come and go after the airdrop is over.\nI think a good and well-built reward system is essential for the project, but the community you\u2019re targeting and your approach towards it should be taken into consideration."

                "comment": "Good topic. A few practical ways we can grow engagement and visibility in my opinion, which we are doing already at Metis:\n\u2022 Short-form builder stories (Vibe sessions). Builders connect with people, not just product updates but get live questions and Answer sessions with Metis Devrel and community\n\u2022 One thing i would love to see and working on it to make it happen is to run weekly digests or highlights from the forum. So we have some overview of what is happening on major areas\n\u2022 Recognize effort, not noise. Badges and points should reflect real value, not post count. Curated community highlights help. Weekly or bi-weekly digests showcasing forum posts, guild updates, or active contributors can go a long way.\nIf we want this to scale, the system has to be simple and that\u2019s what Hyperion Forum is about, consistent, and fairness are key.\nLet me know what you think"

                "comment": "Hi everyone!\nGreat topic\u2014growing the Hyperion ecosystem will depend heavily on how engaged and motivated the community feels. Here are a few ideas I believe could make a real difference:\nSocial Media & Content Creation\n#BuiltOnHyperion Campaigns: Encourage devs and creators to share what they\u2019ve built, with visuals or demo videos\u2014could even turn into a recurring series.\nCreator Grants or Bounties for blog posts, tutorials, or videos explaining how to use parts of the Hyperion stack.\nShort-form video contests explaining Hyperion concepts in <60 seconds (e.g., reels, TikToks).\nEvents & Interactive Engagement\nHyperion Town Halls or Office Hours: Monthly check-ins with the team or contributors to align on priorities and share updates.\nThemed Community Weeks: For example, \u201cInfrastructure Week\u201d or \u201cGaming on Hyperion Week,\u201d where focused discussions, demos, and content happen.\nBuild & Earn hackathons (virtual or local) that encourage people to create tools, apps, or content.\nRewards, Recognition & Incentives\nHyperion XP System: Points for meaningful contributions (support, content, feedback, dev work), leading to levels, roles, and perks.\nDynamic badges/NFTs for community achievements\u2014like \u201cValidator,\u201d \u201cEarly Supporter,\u201d \u201cCommunity Helper,\u201d etc.\nLeaderboard Dashboards to publicly celebrate top contributors across categories.\nCampaign Ideas\n\u201cHelp Build the Hyperion Wiki\u201d: Incentivize community-led documentation, FAQs, or beginner guides.\nMonthly Contribution Challenges: e.g. \u201cWrite a guide,\u201d \u201cTranslate docs,\u201d or \u201cAnswer 10 questions on Discord.\u201d\nOverall, the more visible and valued contributions feel, the more people will want to get involved. Hyperion already has a strong tech foundation\u2014now it\u2019s about building a passionate, collaborative culture on top of it.\nWould love to hear if others have tried systems like these\u2014or have totally different approaches!"

                "comment": "Let\u2019s be real: most devs don\u2019t read docs.\nThey search, scan, copy, and hope for the best.\nAnd now, in 2025, it\u2019s not just humans doing that\u2014AI agents are reading your docs too.\nWhich means your documentation isn\u2019t just for the developer at their desk anymore.\nIt\u2019s for the ChatGPT plugin trying to help them.\nGood docs now have two audiences:\nHumans who want to build\nMachines trying to help them build faster\nSo\u2026 what does great look like?\n1. Start With \u201cLet Me Try It\u201d\nThere should always be one clear, dead-simple path to success:\n\u201cHow do I test this without thinking too much?\u201d\nNot \u201clearn our architecture.\u201d\nNot \u201cread 10 config files.\u201d\nJust:\nClone \u2192\nRun \u2192\n\u201cOh cool, that worked.\u201d\n2. Search That Doesn\u2019t Suck\nSearch isn\u2019t a nice-to-have anymore.\nIt\u2019s the difference between a dev staying on your page or hitting up Twitter.\nIn 2025, AI-assisted coding means:\nClear structure with real headings\nDescriptive metadata\nFunction signatures with real examples\nSo whether it\u2019s a person Googling a CLI flag or a codegen tool parsing your API docs\u2014you\u2019ve got to make your content discoverable.\nBonus tip: structured docs with OpenAPI, JSON Schema, etc. help AI understand your system better than any marketing page ever will.\n3. Sound Like a Human. Teach Like a Mentor.\nNobody wants to feel like they\u2019re reading compliance documentation.\nGood docs today feel like:\n\u201cHere\u2019s what you\u2019re doing, here\u2019s why it matters, and here\u2019s what might break.\u201d\nLess robotic. More real.\nAnd yes\u2014tools like GPT will pull exact lines from your docs into dev workflows. So make them worth quoting.\n4. Connected, Interactive, and Contextual\nDon\u2019t make your docs a dead end.\nLink to community answers\nEmbed live code editors (Replit, Codesandbox)\nInclude working curl commands, CLI flags, or Postman collections\nEven better? Let AI navigate it.\nMake it easy for language models to jump across docs, get parameters, and form full code blocks that actually work.\nDocs are no longer pages\u2014they\u2019re APIs in disguise.\n5. Updated Like Code. Written for Both Worlds.\nYour docs are now part of your product surface.\nThey should:\nShow last updated timestamps\nBe versioned with your releases\nUse structured formats (Markdown + frontmatter, OpenAPI, etc.)\nIf a dev tools AI can\u2019t parse your docs\u2014it can\u2019t help your users.\nAnd if a real dev hits outdated content, they lose trust fast.\nIn both cases? They leave.\nTL;DR \u2014 Docs Are Your Second Interface\nIn 2025, documentation isn\u2019t just a \u201chow-to\u201d for users.\nIt\u2019s a conversation between your product and every developer, AI, plugin, or bot that touches it.\nGreat docs today:\nBuild confidence\nLower time-to-first-success\nHelp humans and machines speak the same language"

AI can be helpful \u2014 answering frequently asked questions, sharing official links, or providing updated project information. But the presence of human admins is always crucial.\nWhat often makes it worse is when humans start mimicking bots themselves, replying with scripted, impersonal messages. Authentic, organic communication matters. It\u2019s about speaking not just on behalf of the project or the team but on behalf of the community too.\nIt means sharing your ups and downs, asking for support when you need it, and offering support when others do.\nEmpathy, compassion, and authenticity are what make any interaction feel real \u2014 and what ultimately builds trust."

It would be a great way to gather like-minded builders, share content, and collaborate on the ecosystem.\nA seperate section for documentation in the forum: When I joined Hyperhack, I struggled to find organized documentation for Metis, LazAI, and Alith. A dedicated section or hub for all docs would be a big help for newcomers like me."

Since I created the original forum post, I\u2019ve been assigned the \u201cHyperHack Project Initiator\u201d tag, which gives me access to tag-specific private groups and updates.\nHowever, my co-founder \u2014 who\u2019s actively building the project alongside me \u2014 doesn\u2019t have the same tag and can\u2019t access those private discussions or updates. We recently discovered this issue after the post about Spotlight Campaign.\nIs there a way to either:\nAdd him to the same private groups/chats, or\nAssign him the Project Initiator tag as well?\nWe want to make sure we\u2019re both receiving the same updates and can coordinate effectively with the community."

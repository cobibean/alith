Last week, I dove into the very first Build & Chill Workshop run by LazAI\u2019s DevRel squad \u2014 shoutout to @0xthiru and @nidhinakranii for running the show. The whole thing was super hands-on. We weren\u2019t just watching slides; we were actually minting our own private DATs (Data Anchoring Tokens) with a little Python magic. Mint.py\nBasically, we were getting under the hood of LazAI\u2019s data registry \u2014 learning how data anchoring works, why it matters for privacy, and how you can actually trace stuff without exposing it. Pretty slick.\nThe mint.py script handles all the heavy lifting: encrypts your file so no one\u2019s peeking, shoots it up to IPFS via Pinata, registers it on the blockchain as a DAT, and even chases down a proof and an on-chain reward for you.

                "comment": "Alright, story time. Last week, I dove into the very first Build & Chill Workshop run by LazAI\u2019s DevRel squad \u2014 shoutout to @0xthiru and @nidhinakranii for running the show. The whole thing was super hands-on. We weren\u2019t just watching slides; we were actually minting our own private DATs (Data Anchoring Tokens) with a little Python magic. Mint.py\nBasically, we were getting under the hood of LazAI\u2019s data registry \u2014 learning how data anchoring works, why it matters for privacy, and how you can actually trace stuff without exposing it. Pretty slick.\nThe mint.py script handles all the heavy lifting: encrypts your file so no one\u2019s peeking, shoots it up to IPFS via Pinata, registers it on the blockchain as a DAT, and even chases down a proof and an on-chain reward for you.

        "content": "Build Your Digital Twin Using LazAI\nby Danny Steffe | LazAI Dev Ambassador\nEver wished your AI could tweet like you \u2014 same tone, same quirks, same vibe?\nThat\u2019s exactly what LazAI\u2019s Digital Twin does.Your Digital Twin is an AI persona trained on your own content. It speaks in your voice, understands your style, and can even post on your behalf \u2014 either manually or on a schedule.\nLet\u2019s walk through how it works and how to build your own.\nWhat\u2019s a Digital Twin?\nIn LazAI, a Digital Twin is your AI clone \u2014 a portable, interoperable persona that lives in a single JSON file called character.json.\nThat file defines your style, tone, traits, and examples \u2014 basically, your digital personality.\nThe beauty of it: any Alith agent or LLM can load it instantly.\nWhy use one?\nPortable persona: one JSON file, usable across any LLM or agent.\nSeparation of concerns: keep your style/persona in JSON and logic in code.\nComposable: swap personas without touching the backend.\nPrerequisites\nYou\u2019ll need:\nmacOS / WSL / Linux with Node.js 18+\nAn OpenAI or Anthropic (Claude) API key\nYour Twitter/X archive (.zip)\nStep 0 \u2014 Setup\nClone the starter kit and install dependencies:\ngit clone https://github.com/0xLazAI/Digital-Twin-Starter-kit.git\ncd Digital-Twin-Starter-kit\nStep 1 \u2014 Generate Your Characterfile\nThis step turns your tweet history into a Digital Twin.\nRequest your archive\nFrom X/Twitter \u2192 Settings \u2192 Download an archive.\nGenerate your character.json\nnpx tweets2character ~/Downloads/twitter-YYYY-MM-DD-<hash>.zip\nChoose OpenAI or Claude\nPaste your API key when prompted\nOutput: character.json in your current directory\nPlace it in your project root\n/Digital-Twin-Starter-kit\n  \u251c\u2500 controller/\n  \u251c\u2500 services/\n  \u251c\u2500 routes/\n  \u251c\u2500 character.json   \u2190 here\n  \u2514\u2500 index.js\nStep 2 \u2014 Integrate with an Alith Agent\nNow, let\u2019s bring your character to life.\nLazAI uses Alith, a modular agent framework, to load your character.json as a preamble \u2014 the persona context fed into an LLM.\nYour agent will:\nLoad character.json\nGenerate a tweet in your tone\nPost it manually or automatically\nExample:\nconst { Agent, LLM } = await import('alith');\n\nconst characterData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./character.json', 'utf8'));\n\nconst preamble = [\n  `You are ${characterData.name}.`,\n  characterData.bio?.join(' ') || '',\n  characterData.lore ? `Lore: ${characterData.lore.join(' ')}` : '',\n  characterData.style?.post ? `Style for posts: ${characterData.style.post.join(' ')}` : ''\n].filter(Boolean).join('\\n');\n\nconst model = LLM.from_model_name('gpt-4o-mini');\nconst agent = Agent.new('twitter_agent', model).preamble(preamble);\n\nconst chat = agent.chat();\nconst result = await chat.user(`Write one tweet in ${characterData.name}'s voice.`).complete();\nconsole.log(result.content);\nThe persona is decoupled from the logic, so you can swap character.json anytime without touching your backend.\nStep 3 \u2014 Automate Tweets with Cron\nLet your Digital Twin tweet for you automatically.\nHere\u2019s how:\nconst cron = require('node-cron');\nconst { postTweetCron } = require('../controller/twitterController');\n\ncron.schedule('* * * * *', async () => {\n  await postTweetCron();\n}, {\n  scheduled: true,\n  timezone: \"UTC\"\n});\nThis runs every minute (you can adjust it).\nBehind the scenes, your Alith agent wakes up, loads your character.json, and posts a new tweet in your style.\nEnvironment Variables\n# .env\nTWITTER_USERNAME=username\nTWITTER_PASSWORD=password\nTWITTER_EMAIL=email\n\nLLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini\nALITH_API_KEY=your_key_if_required\nInstall deps:\nnpm i alith node-cron\nStep 4 \u2014 Manual Test\nRun locally to test your setup:\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tweet \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"username\":\"someone\"}'\nStart your app:\nnpm run dev\nUpdating Your Twin\nWant a new version of yourself?\nJust regenerate your file:\nnpx tweets2character <path_to_new_archive.zip>\nReplace your existing character.json, restart the server \u2014 and your new personality is live.\nArchitecture Sketch\nUser Tweets \u2192 tweets2character \u2192 character.json \n      \u2193\n  Alith Agent \u2190 character.json (persona)\n      \u2193\n  LLM (OpenAI/Claude)\n      \u2193\n  tweetController.js \u2192 Twitter API",

It speaks in your voice, understands your style, and can even post on your behalf \u2014 either manually or on a schedule.\nLet\u2019s walk through how it works and how to build your own.\nWhat\u2019s a Digital Twin?\nIn LazAI, a Digital Twin is your AI clone \u2014 a portable, interoperable persona that lives in a single JSON file called character.json.\nThat file defines your style, tone, traits, and examples \u2014 basically, your digital personality.\nThe beauty of it: any Alith agent or LLM can load it instantly.\nWhy use one?\nPortable persona: one JSON file, usable across any LLM or agent.\nSeparation of concerns: keep your style/persona in JSON and logic in code.\nComposable: swap personas without touching the backend.\nPrerequisites\nYou\u2019ll need:\nmacOS / WSL / Linux with Node.js 18+\nAn OpenAI or Anthropic (Claude) API key\nYour Twitter/X archive (.zip)\nStep 0 \u2014 Setup\nClone the starter kit and install dependencies:\ngit clone https://github.com/0xLazAI/Digital-Twin-Starter-kit.git\ncd Digital-Twin-Starter-kit\nStep 1 \u2014 Generate Your Characterfile\nThis step turns your tweet history into a Digital Twin.\nRequest your archive\nFrom X/Twitter \u2192 Settings \u2192 Download an archive.\nGenerate your character.json\nnpx tweets2character ~/Downloads/twitter-YYYY-MM-DD-<hash>.zip\nChoose OpenAI or Claude\nPaste your API key when prompted\nOutput: character.json in your current directory\nPlace it in your project root\n/Digital-Twin-Starter-kit\n  \u251c\u2500 controller/\n  \u251c\u2500 services/\n  \u251c\u2500 routes/\n  \u251c\u2500 character.json   \u2190 here\n  \u2514\u2500 index.js\nStep 2 \u2014 Integrate with an Alith Agent\nNow, let\u2019s bring your character to life.\nLazAI uses Alith, a modular agent framework, to load your character.json as a preamble \u2014 the persona context fed into an LLM.\nYour agent will:\nLoad character.json\nGenerate a tweet in your tone\nPost it manually or automatically\nExample:\nconst { Agent, LLM } = await import('alith');\n\nconst characterData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./character.json', 'utf8'));\n\nconst preamble = [\n  `You are ${characterData.name}.`,\n  characterData.bio?.join(' ') || '',\n  characterData.lore ? `Lore: ${characterData.lore.join(' ')}` : '',\n  characterData.style?.post ? `Style for posts: ${characterData.style.post.join(' ')}` : ''\n].filter(Boolean).join('\\n');\n\nconst model = LLM.from_model_name('gpt-4o-mini');\nconst agent = Agent.new('twitter_agent', model).preamble(preamble);\n\nconst chat = agent.chat();\nconst result = await chat.user(`Write one tweet in ${characterData.name}'s voice.`).complete();\nconsole.log(result.content);\nThe persona is decoupled from the logic, so you can swap character.json anytime without touching your backend.\nStep 3 \u2014 Automate Tweets with Cron\nLet your Digital Twin tweet for you automatically.\nHere\u2019s how:\nconst cron = require('node-cron');\nconst { postTweetCron } = require('../controller/twitterController');\n\ncron.schedule('* * * * *', async () => {\n  await postTweetCron();\n}, {\n  scheduled: true,\n  timezone: \"UTC\"\n});\nThis runs every minute (you can adjust it).\nBehind the scenes, your Alith agent wakes up, loads your character.json, and posts a new tweet in your style.\nEnvironment Variables\n# .env\nTWITTER_USERNAME=username\nTWITTER_PASSWORD=password\nTWITTER_EMAIL=email\n\nLLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini\nALITH_API_KEY=your_key_if_required\nInstall deps:\nnpm i alith node-cron\nStep 4 \u2014 Manual Test\nRun locally to test your setup:\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tweet \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"username\":\"someone\"}'\nStart your app:\nnpm run dev\nUpdating Your Twin\nWant a new version of yourself?\nJust regenerate your file:\nnpx tweets2character <path_to_new_archive.zip>\nReplace your existing character.json, restart the server \u2014 and your new personality is live.\nArchitecture Sketch\nUser Tweets \u2192 tweets2character \u2192 character.json \n      \u2193\n  Alith Agent \u2190 character.json (persona)\n      \u2193\n  LLM (OpenAI/Claude)\n      \u2193\n  tweetController.js \u2192 Twitter API"

When you code together, you build capability.\u201d\nConclusion: My Beginner Perspective\nAs a beginner, I\u2019ve learned that both experiences matter. Coding alone gave me courage \u2014 to experiment, to fail, and to learn by doing.

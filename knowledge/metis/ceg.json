        "content": "Your DAO just voted to increase validator rewards by 200%. Six months later, network security hasn\u2019t improved, but token inflation is destroying community confidence. Nobody wants to talk about reversing the decision because \u201cwe voted on it.\u201d\nThis is the meta-governance problem: we build systems that make decisions, but we don\u2019t build systems that learn from those decisions.\nThe Learning Gap in Governance\nMost governance frameworks are designed to optimize decision-making. They create voting mechanisms, delegate structures, and proposal processes. But they rarely ask: how will we know if this decision was wrong? How will we capture what we learn? How will we improve next time?\nI\u2019ve observed DAOs repeating the same mistakes across different proposals because they lack institutional memory. Smart people often make the same cognitive errors because the system fails to recognize them.\nThis isn\u2019t just a crypto problem. Traditional organizations also struggle with this. But at least corporations can pivot quickly when the CEO realizes something isn\u2019t working. Decentralized systems need explicit learning mechanisms because there\u2019s no single person who can say, \u201cThis was stupid, let\u2019s try something else.\u201d\nPhilosophical Foundations\nThe concept of meta-governance draws from several philosophical traditions that help us understand why learning systems matter:\nAristotelian Virtue Ethics: Aristotle argued that excellence is not an act but a habit. Meta-governance applies this to institutional behaviour - good governance isn\u2019t about making one perfect decision, but about building habits that consistently improve decision-making quality over time.\nEvolutionary Epistemology: Karl Popper\u2019s ideas about knowledge growth through conjecture and refutation apply directly to governance systems. We propose governance mechanisms (conjecture), test them through implementation (experimentation), and refine them based on outcomes (refutation of what doesn\u2019t work).\nSystems Thinking: Peter Senge\u2019s concept of the \u201clearning organization\u201d emphasizes that sustainable competitive advantage comes from an organization\u2019s ability to learn faster than its environment changes. In rapidly evolving crypto markets, governance systems that can\u2019t learn become obsolete.\nPragmatist Philosophy: John Dewey\u2019s emphasis on learning through experience and reflection provides the foundation for retrospective-based governance improvement. Truth isn\u2019t abstract but emerges through engagement with real-world consequences.\nWhat Meta-Governance Actually Means\nMeta-governance is governance about governance. It\u2019s the system that watches your governance system and asks: is this working? What are we missing? What should we do differently?\nThink of it as the difference between a thermostat and a smart home system. A thermostat maintains temperature. A smart home system learns your patterns, adjusts to weather changes, and optimizes for efficiency over time.\nMost DAOs have thermostats. They need smart home systems.\nThe Core Components of Learning Systems\n1. Decision Outcome Tracking\nEvery governance decision should include success criteria and measurement timelines. Not just \u201cincrease validator rewards\u201d but \u201cincrease validator rewards to improve network uptime to 99.9% within 6 months, measured by [specific metrics].\u201d\nWithout explicit success criteria, you can\u2019t evaluate whether decisions were effective. Without evaluation, you can\u2019t learn.\n2. Systematic Retrospectives\nThis is where the project post-mortem mindset becomes crucial. In software development, retrospectives are standard practice. Teams regularly ask: What went well? What went poorly? What should we change?\nGovernance needs the same discipline. After major decisions are made, there should be a structured reflection: Did we achieve what we intended? What unexpected consequences emerged? What would we do differently?\n3. Pattern Recognition\nIndividual retrospectives are useful. Patterns across retrospectives are transformative. Meta-governance systems should track recurring themes: Do we consistently underestimate implementation timelines? Do certain types of proposals always fail? Do we have blind spots around specific risks?\nThe goal isn\u2019t to blame anyone. It\u2019s to recognize systemic tendencies and build guardrails accordingly.\n4. Adaptive Mechanisms\nLearning is worthless without the ability to act on it. Meta-governance systems require mechanisms to adapt governance processes based on the insights they gain.\nPerhaps you discover that community sentiment polls predict proposal success more accurately than delegate votes. Perhaps you discover that proposals introduced during specific market conditions are consistently rejected. The system should be able to evolve its own processes.\nA Framework for Meta-Governance Implementation\nPhase 1: Decision Architecture (Month 1) Start by standardizing how decisions get documented. Every proposal should include:\nClear success metrics\nTimeline for evaluation\nAssumptions being tested\nRisk factors identified\nPhase 2: Retrospective Rhythm (Month 2-3) Institute regular governance retrospectives. Monthly or quarterly, depending on decision frequency. The key is consistency and structure:\nWhat decisions were evaluated this period?\nWhich ones met their success criteria?\nWhat patterns are emerging?\nWhat governance process changes should we consider?\nPhase 3: Pattern Database (Month 4-6) Create systems to track learnings across time. This could be as simple as a shared document or as sophisticated as a decision outcomes dashboard. The point is institutional memory that transcends individual participants.\nPhase 4: Adaptive Protocols (Month 6+) Implement mechanisms to modify governance based on learning. This might mean:\nAutomatic cooling-off periods for similar proposals that recently failed\nRequired risk assessments for proposals that match failure patterns\nEnhanced due diligence for decision types with poor track records\nThe Retrospective Mindset Applied to Governance\nIn Agile software development, retrospectives are sacred. Teams that skip retrospectives ship buggy code and burn out their developers. Teams that do them well continuously improve their velocity and code quality.\nGovernance needs the same discipline. We should be asking questions like:\nWhich governance decisions from the past quarter actually improved outcomes for our community?\nWhat governance processes slowed down good decisions or enabled bad ones?\nWhere did our assumptions about community preferences turn out to be wrong?\nWhat would we do differently if we had to design this governance process from scratch today?\nThe key insight from Agile retrospectives: you can\u2019t improve what you don\u2019t examine. And you can\u2019t examine what you don\u2019t measure.\nWhy Most Communities Skip This\nMeta-governance feels like overhead when you\u2019re trying to ship features and grow adoption. Retrospectives can feel like navel-gazing when there are urgent decisions to be made.\nBut this is exactly backwards. The busier your governance system gets, the more you need learning mechanisms. The higher the stakes of your decisions, the more important it becomes to learn from mistakes.\nCommunities that skip meta-governance end up like that DAO with 200% validator reward inflation: technically functional but strategically adrift.\nBuilding Anti-Fragile Governance\nThe goal isn\u2019t perfect governance. Perfect governance doesn\u2019t exist. The goal is governance that gets better under stress.\nWhen a major proposal fails spectacularly, an anti-fragile governance system doesn\u2019t just move on to the next decision. It asks: What did this failure teach us about our blind spots? How can we refine our processes to make more informed decisions next time?\nWhen market conditions change and old governance assumptions no longer apply, adaptive systems recognize the shift and evolve accordingly. Static systems continually make decisions based on outdated mental models.\nStarting Small, Thinking Big\nYou don\u2019t need to implement a comprehensive meta-governance infrastructure immediately. Start with basic retrospectives after major decisions. Add outcome tracking for new proposals. Build the habit of asking, \u201cWhat did we learn?\u201d before moving on to the next issue.\nThe key is consistency. Meta-governance works through compound learning effects. Each retrospective makes the next one more valuable. Each pattern you recognize makes the system slightly smarter.\nOver time, this builds governance systems that not only make decisions but also make better ones.\nThe Connection to Broader Governance Challenges\nThis connects to the governance paradox we discussed earlier. Smart people make bad collective decisions partly because individual intelligence doesn\u2019t scale to group dynamics without explicit learning systems.\nMeta-governance is the process of scaling intelligence to the organizational level. It\u2019s how we build systems that are smarter than the smartest person in them.\nThe environmental influence patterns we\u2019ve explored apply here too. Governance systems create their own environments that shape how participants think and act. Without meta-governance, these environments can become echo chambers that reinforce poor decision-making patterns.\nThis also relates to trust debt - communities that don\u2019t learn from governance failures accumulate trust debt over time. Each unexamined bad decision makes stakeholders less likely to participate meaningfully in future governance.\nYou can\u2019t \u201cgive\u201d someone responsibility for meta-governance. They have to grab it because they understand that better governance ultimately serves everyone\u2019s interests - much like the ownership principles we\u2019ve discussed in making work engaging.\nWhat This Means for Metis\nAt Metis, we\u2019re experimenting with these ideas in our own governance evolution. We\u2019re building retrospective processes into our decision-making cycles. We\u2019re tracking outcomes of major proposals and asking hard questions about what we\u2019re learning.\nWe haven\u2019t figured it out yet. But we\u2019re building systems that learn how to learn. That\u2019s the foundation for governance that improves over time rather than just accumulating decisions.\nThe goal isn\u2019t to become governance experts overnight. It aims to become a community that improves its governance through practice, reflection, and continuous improvement.\nThat\u2019s how we build systems worthy of the future we\u2019re trying to create.\nPhilosophical Foundations\nThe concept of meta-governance draws from several philosophical traditions that help us understand why learning systems matter:\nAristotelian Virtue Ethics: Aristotle argued that excellence is not an act but a habit. Meta-governance applies this to institutional behaviour - good governance isn\u2019t about making one perfect decision, but about building habits that consistently improve decision-making quality over time.\nEvolutionary Epistemology: Karl Popper\u2019s ideas about knowledge growth through conjecture and refutation apply directly to governance systems.

Yet over time, in 2025 we can say that much of the crypto space has leaned toward centralization. This shift isn\u2019t necessarily a betrayal, it actually reflects the realities of markets, regulation, and what people actually might still today prefer to use.\nWhy Centralization Is Rising\nRegulation & Compliance. To work with banks and institutions, firms need to follow KYC/AML rules\u2014often pushing them toward centralized structures.\nEconomies of Scale.

Most of the industry\u2019s liquidity and activity happens here because it\u2019s convenient and regulated.\nSelf-custody wallets (software or hardware) let users control their own keys. While safer in principle, adoption is lower because managing private keys and security is more complex.\nReal-World Example: Trump\u2019s Memecoin Dinner\nOn May 22, 2025, reports suggested that President Trump may have hosted a private black-tie dinner at his golf club in Virginia for top investors in his meme coin, $TRUMP. Some accounts claim that the highest contributors could have received VIP treatment, and possibly even gifts like luxury watches.\nThe event attracted attention and speculation. Observers noted that, if it did take place, it could raise questions about ethical boundaries, conflicts of interest, and the intersection of political influence and personal profit. Any official statements indicated it would have been a private gathering, separate from presidential duties.\nWhat It Tells Us\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily a breakdown of the decentralization idea, but it does reflect how the crypto world is evolving into a hybrid ecosystem:\nDecentralized foundations, via protocols like DEXs, smart contracts, Layer-2s like Metis, zk-tech, and decentralized staking, still enable trustless innovation and access.\nCentralized overlay, where services, capital, and political connections concentrate among platforms and powerful players.\nA Shift, Not a Collapse\nCentralization doesn\u2019t mean decentralization has failed, it\u2019s more like a trade-off.

        "content": "\u201cNothing that is worth knowing can be taught.\u201d \u2014 Oscar Wilde\nWilde understood something about human nature that most governance designers miss. You can teach someone the mechanics of proposal creation, voting weights, and execution timelines. You cannot teach them to overcome the psychological traps that make those mechanics fail when it matters most.\nSmart people consistently make poor governance decisions in Web3. This isn\u2019t about intelligence or technical knowledge. It\u2019s about how distributed authority amplifies cognitive biases that even reasonable people may not realize they have.\nThe Intelligence Trap\nTraditional decision-making relies on hierarchy, information flow, and clear accountability. Remove those structures and something changes. Research on professional decision-making reveals that experts in management, finance, medicine, and law all exhibit systematic cognitive biases, with overconfidence being the most prevalent bias across these domains.\nIn corporate settings, overconfidence* is often tempered by supervisors, peer review, and clear performance metrics. In token-based governance, overconfidence compounds. Proposal authors become more certain that their ideas will work. Voters become more confident in evaluating complex changes. The usual checks disappear.\nAnchoring** bias works differently, too. In traditional settings, initial proposals get challenged through structured review processes. In DAO governance, the first detailed proposal often establishes the mental framework for all subsequent discussions. Studies of federal judges reveal that even trained legal professionals are susceptible to anchoring, framing, and confirmation biases when evaluating cases.\n*Overconfidence bias is the tendency to overestimate our own abilities, knowledge, or chances of success. In corporate settings, this is typically reviewed by supervisors, peer review, and clear performance metrics.\n**Anchoring bias occurs when people rely too heavily on the first piece of information they encounter when making decisions.\nPsychology of Pseudonymous Participation\nToken governance creates entirely new psychological dynamics. When people participate through pseudonymous identities, social proof mechanisms break down. In regular meetings, you can read facial expressions, gauge confidence levels, and pick up on hesitation. These signals help groups avoid groupthink and spot weak reasoning.\nPseudonymous governance removes these signals. A whale\u2019s vote carries the same apparent confidence whether they spent five minutes or five hours analyzing a proposal. New participants often struggle to distinguish between informed convictions and casual opinions. The result is systematic misjudgment about collective decision quality.\nThe absence of repeated face-to-face interaction also changes accountability psychology. When you know you\u2019ll see the same people next week, you\u2019re more careful about supporting risky proposals. When governance occurs through temporary usernames and wallet addresses, the psychological cost of being wrong is reduced.\nWhere Governance Design Goes Wrong\nMost governance frameworks assume rational actors with complete information. They prioritize process efficiency over decision quality. The result is systems that work perfectly in theory and consistently produce poor outcomes in practice.\nThis connects to our discussion about analysis paralysis. Individual decision paralysis scales to governance paralysis when multiple smart people each demand perfect information before supporting proposals.\nCommon design mistakes include treating all token holders as equally informed participants, assuming people will research proposals in proportion to their voting weight, and creating voting mechanisms that fail to surface uncertainty or confidence levels.\nDesigning for Psychological Reality\nBetter governance systems account for how people actually think and behave in uncertain situations. Instead of fighting cognitive biases, effective designs work with them.\nStructured Uncertainty: Build processes that force participants to express confidence levels, not just preferences. When someone votes yes on a proposal, require them to estimate the probability of success. This simple change reduces overconfidence bias by making uncertainty explicit.\nDevil\u2019s Advocate Processes: Assign roles specifically for finding problems with popular proposals. Make skepticism an integral part of the formal process, rather than relying on it to emerge naturally.\nDelayed Implementation: Create cooling-off periods between voting and execution. This gives communities time to identify problems they may have missed during the initial discussion and reduces the influence of first impressions.\nReputation Tracking: Connect voting records to outcome tracking. People become more careful when their decision-making track record is visible over time.\nThe Learning Challenge\nThe deeper problem is that governance systems rarely learn from their failures. When a proposal goes awry, communities tend to blame the execution rather than examining the decision-making processes. They change parameters instead of understanding why smart people supported something that didn\u2019t work.\nEffective governance requires building feedback loops that connect decisions to outcomes and outcomes back to process improvement. This means tracking not just what gets decided, but how decisions get made and why they succeed or fail.\nWe\u2019ll explore this challenge in depth when we examine how protocols can build meta-governance systems that learn from their own decision-making patterns in the upcoming article.\nPractical Steps for Operators\nStart with one governance process your community uses regularly. Audit it for bias amplifiers. Where does overconfidence get rewarded? Where do people anchor to incomplete information? Where does pseudonymous participation hide uncertainty?\nExperiment with structured uncertainty. In your next proposal discussion, ask supporters to estimate the success probability alongside their \u2018yes\u2019 votes. Ask opponents to specify what evidence would change their minds.\nCreate explicit roles for skepticism. Rotate responsibility for finding problems with popular ideas. Make it someone\u2019s job to ask hard questions rather than hoping criticism emerges naturally.\nMost importantly, track outcomes and connect them to the decision-making processes. When proposals succeed or fail, examine not just what was decided but how the decision got made.\nBeyond Individual Decisions\nThe real insight is that governance isn\u2019t about making perfect individual decisions; it\u2019s about making informed collective decisions. It\u2019s about building systems that make good decisions consistently over time. This requires understanding how psychological factors compound in decentralized environments and designing processes that account for human nature rather than fighting it.\nThis connects to concepts we\u2019ve explored about distributed accountability and environmental influence. Effective governance requires systems that help intelligent people learn from political experience rather than relying solely on analytical capabilities.\nSmart people don\u2019t make terrible governance decisions because they lack intelligence. They make terrible decisions because the systems they operate in amplify their cognitive blind spots while removing the usual corrective mechanisms.\nThe solution isn\u2019t smarter people. It\u2019s smarter systems that help intelligent people make better decisions together.\nPhilosophical Foundations\nBehavioral Economics (Kahneman, Tversky): Human decision-making under uncertainty follows predictable patterns that deviate from rational choice theory, especially under conditions of distributed authority.\nSocial Psychology (Janis, Cialdini): Group dynamics create systematic biases that individual intelligence cannot overcome without structural intervention and explicit bias-checking processes.\nSystems Thinking (Senge, Meadows): Complex systems require feedback mechanisms that connect decisions to outcomes and enable continuous learning from governance failures.\nEpistemic Humility (Tetlock): Better decisions come from acknowledging uncertainty and building processes that surface what we don\u2019t know rather than optimizing for apparent confidence.",

Let\u2019s break it down.\n1) Not One Market, But Many\n\u201cNFTs\u201d isn\u2019t one market. It\u2019s multiple segments:\nBlue-chip collectibles / art \u2013 CryptoPunks, Bored Apes, generative art. Cultural assets valued for history, provenance, and community status.\nUtility NFTs \u2013 Game items, tickets, subscriptions. Value comes from daily use, not speculation.\nMembership & social NFTs \u2013 Gated clubs, communities, creator groups.

Most failed.\nSome work well: game passes, season tickets, verified access.\nMany flopped due to poor UX (complex wallets, too many steps).\nUtility only matters when it\u2019s simple, repeatable, and used regularly, not just written in a roadmap.\n4) Cultural Value: Slow but Strong\nCultural NFTs aren\u2019t about utility. They\u2019re about history and curation.\nOpenSea\u2019s reserve is a bet on this: a \u201cdigital museum.\u201d\nStrong curation and patient collectors can keep cultural value alive even during market lows.\n5) The Market Is Fragmented\nAttention is now niche-driven: Discord groups, creator channels, curated drops, and specific platforms.\nMass-market hype launches like 2021 don\u2019t work anymore.\n6) Regulation & IP Issues\nLegal uncertainty is a risk:\nWhat rights do buyers get (display, commercial, derivative)?\nAre royalties enforceable across marketplaces?\nCould fractionalized NFTs be securities?\nBuilders need legal clarity, especially for real-world assets.\n7) Composability & Infrastructure\nNFTs are powerful because they\u2019re composable, usable across games, protocols, and apps.\nBut this only works if standards and integrations exist. Without adoption, many NFTs stay theoretical.\n8) Creator Economics & Royalties\nRoyalties were supposed to create steady revenue. Reality is messy:\nSome platforms honor royalties, others ignore them.\nCreators need sustainable business models beyond royalties\u2026 memberships, services, products.\n9) Who Should Still Build NFTs?\nNFTs make sense if:\nYou create real, repeated value (daily-used game item, on-chain subscription).\nYou curate cultural assets with provenance and meaning.\nYou offer measurable benefits: events, gated content, revenue share.\nIf the goal is \u201cmint, hype, flip,\u201d the market won\u2019t care.\n10) Key Questions Before Minting\nAsk yourself:\nWho will use this NFT next week? Next month?\nWhat will holders actually do with it?\nCan we deliver benefits without complex UX?\nHow do we keep value if the market cools?\nWhat legal rights are we selling?\nWhere will liquidity come from?\nIf you can\u2019t answer, build the product or partnerships first.\n11) Metrics That Matter\nForget vanity stats like floor price. Look at:\nActive unique holders using the NFT.\nRepeat use of NFT features (logins, sessions, events).\nMarket depth (buyers vs sellers).\nHolder concentration (community vs whales).\nLong-term retention.\nFinal Thoughts\nNFTs aren\u2019t dead. They\u2019re not magic either. They\u2019re tools.\nThe market is mature: copy-paste drops don\u2019t work.\nNFTs are still powerful for art, culture, gaming, memberships, and on-chain proof of ownership, but projects need honest planning around liquidity, UX, and legal realities.\nWhat do you think?\nAre NFTs dead, or are they just evolving? Are they still part of your plans in 2025, or do you think this chapter is closed?",

Reality is messy:\nSome platforms honor royalties, others ignore them.\nCreators need sustainable business models beyond royalties\u2026 memberships, services, products.\n9) Who Should Still Build NFTs?\nNFTs make sense if:\nYou create real, repeated value (daily-used game item, on-chain subscription).\nYou curate cultural assets with provenance and meaning.\nYou offer measurable benefits: events, gated content, revenue share.\nIf the goal is \u201cmint, hype, flip,\u201d the market won\u2019t care.\n10) Key Questions Before Minting\nAsk yourself:\nWho will use this NFT next week? Next month?\nWhat will holders actually do with it?\nCan we deliver benefits without complex UX?\nHow do we keep value if the market cools?\nWhat legal rights are we selling?\nWhere will liquidity come from?\nIf you can\u2019t answer, build the product or partnerships first.\n11) Metrics That Matter\nForget vanity stats like floor price. Look at:\nActive unique holders using the NFT.\nRepeat use of NFT features (logins, sessions, events).\nMarket depth (buyers vs sellers).\nHolder concentration (community vs whales).\nLong-term retention.\nFinal Thoughts\nNFTs aren\u2019t dead. They\u2019re not magic either. They\u2019re tools.\nThe market is mature: copy-paste drops don\u2019t work.\nNFTs are still powerful for art, culture, gaming, memberships, and on-chain proof of ownership, but projects need honest planning around liquidity, UX, and legal realities.\nWhat do you think?\nAre NFTs dead, or are they just evolving? Are they still part of your plans in 2025, or do you think this chapter is closed?"

Players engage in fast-paced, skill-intensive card battles requiring quick thinking and strategy.\nWhat excites us most is creating the first truly trustless card gaming experience more accessible than traditional mobile games. Players compete from anywhere, knowing every move is cryptographically guaranteed fair. This combination of proven fairness, universal accessibility, and addictive gameplay creates unprecedented gaming where skill determines victory, not platform limitations or hidden algorithms.\nMonetisation\nCommunity Engagement Features \u2013 Level Progression\nWe\u2019re introducing a Level-based engagement system to keep our community active, motivated, and rewarded step-by-step.\nLevel 1 \u2013 Introduction & Onboarding\nGoal: Familiarize users with our project, team, and community channels.\nActivities:\nLearn about our project and vision\nMeet the team\nRegister on the Metis Forum\nFollow our official Telegram, X (Twitter), and other social platforms\nOutcome: Users are connected to our ecosystem and ready for the next stage.\nLevel 2 \u2013 Testnet Gameplay\nGoal: Let users experience our app for the first time.\nActivities:\nPlay the testnet version of our game\nExplore basic features and mechanics\nOutcome: Users understand how our game works and feel confident using it.\nLevel 3 \u2013 Competitions\nGoal: Maintain momentum with competitive gameplay.\nActivities:\nJoin challenges and leaderboards\nCompete for rewards\nOutcome: Sustains player interest and encourages skill improvement.\nLevel 4 \u2013 Multiplayer Challenges\nGoal: Promote collaboration and community bonding.\nActivities:\nTeam up or compete in multiplayer modes\nEngage with other players directly\nOutcome: Builds relationships within the community and creates a lively in-game environment.\nLevel 5 \u2013 Incentivized Community Growth\nGoal: Reward loyal players who help grow our ecosystem.\nActivities:\nInvite and onboard new players into Level 1\nMentor newcomers in Levels 2\u20134\nOutcome: Players benefit from rewards while helping expand the community.\nGetting Involved\nJoin the BOLTIS Community:\nAlpha Testing: Sign up for early access at our team discord Theras Labs or Telegram, we won multiple cross-chain game previously and continue to build, and now we intend to build card-game to test core gameplay and provide feedback.

Players compete from anywhere, knowing every move is cryptographically guaranteed fair. This combination of proven fairness, universal accessibility, and addictive gameplay creates unprecedented gaming where skill determines victory, not platform limitations or hidden algorithms.\nMonetisation\nCommunity Engagement Features \u2013 Level Progression\nWe\u2019re introducing a Level-based engagement system to keep our community active, motivated, and rewarded step-by-step.\nLevel 1 \u2013 Introduction & Onboarding\nGoal: Familiarize users with our project, team, and community channels.\nActivities:\nLearn about our project and vision\nMeet the team\nRegister on the Metis Forum\nFollow our official Telegram, X (Twitter), and other social platforms\nOutcome: Users are connected to our ecosystem and ready for the next stage.\nLevel 2 \u2013 Testnet Gameplay\nGoal: Let users experience our app for the first time.\nActivities:\nPlay the testnet version of our game\nExplore basic features and mechanics\nOutcome: Users understand how our game works and feel confident using it.\nLevel 3 \u2013 Competitions\nGoal: Maintain momentum with competitive gameplay.\nActivities:\nJoin challenges and leaderboards\nCompete for rewards\nOutcome: Sustains player interest and encourages skill improvement.\nLevel 4 \u2013 Multiplayer Challenges\nGoal: Promote collaboration and community bonding.\nActivities:\nTeam up or compete in multiplayer modes\nEngage with other players directly\nOutcome: Builds relationships within the community and creates a lively in-game environment.\nLevel 5 \u2013 Incentivized Community Growth\nGoal: Reward loyal players who help grow our ecosystem.\nActivities:\nInvite and onboard new players into Level 1\nMentor newcomers in Levels 2\u20134\nOutcome: Players benefit from rewards while helping expand the community.\nGetting Involved\nJoin the BOLTIS Community:\nAlpha Testing: Sign up for early access at our team discord Theras Labs or Telegram, we won multiple cross-chain game previously and continue to build, and now we intend to build card-game to test core gameplay and provide feedback.

        "content": "Live Link: https://prototypelobbyfpoint.netlify.app/\nWe are thrilled to unveil a monumental leap in the development of Fracture Point, our upcoming tactical TPS game. While our interactive lobby prototype provides a glimpse into the player experience, the true revolution lies in the meticulously crafted on-chain smart contracts and the robust Alith Architecture that power our innovative Proof of Play ecosystem.\nThis past month has been dedicated to building the immutable bedrock of Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 capabilities, focusing on decentralized ownership, verifiable progression, and a player-driven economy.\nFracture Point: The Game Skill, Strategy, and True Digital Ownership\nFracture Point is designed as a high-octane, tactical third-person shooter that demands precision, strategic thinking, and teamwork. We are building a fiercely competitive environment where your skill and dedication are not just recognized, but are fundamentally integrated into the game\u2019s core value system.\nPrepare for:\nIntense FPS Combat: Master diverse weapon loadouts and tactical maneuvers in dynamic, high-stakes engagements.\nDeep Customization: Personalize your agents and unique \u201cvariants\u201d, making your mark on the battlefield.\nCompetitive Progression: Climb verifiable leaderboards, earn genuine rewards, and truly own your in-game achievements.\nThe Proof of Play Revolution: Rewarding Skill On-Chain\nOur commitment to Proof of Play is the defining feature of Fracture Point. This is not a concept; it\u2019s a core, on-chain mechanism ensuring that your active engagement and skillful performance directly translate into verifiable, immutable value and progression within the game\u2019s ecosystem.\nHow Proof of Play works in Fracture Point, powered by our contracts:\nVerifiable Achievements: Through the GameAchievementRegistry.sol contract (which is part of our ClaimManager system), your significant in-game achievements and progression milestones are immutably recorded on the blockchain. This provides transparent, provable recognition for your dedication and skill.\nSkill-Based Rewards: Our FPToken (FracturePoint Token), serving as XP, is minted to players based on their in-game performance (e.g., in Rift events), authorized exclusively by our trusted Alith Oracle. This ensures that rewards are earned through genuine gameplay.\nOn-Chain Progression & Badges: Your accumulated FPToken (XP) can then be burned via the ClaimManager contract to claim unique Rank Badges (ERC-721 NFTs) from the RankBadge.sol contract, signifying your seasonal achievements and skill tier. This process is entirely on-chain, making your rank verifiable and owned.\nPlayer-Driven Ecosystem: This interconnected system ensures that the game\u2019s economy and value are directly influenced and shaped by the collective activity and skilled contributions of its player base.\nThis ensures Fracture Point rewards genuine skill, time invested, and proven performance, fostering a fair, transparent, and truly player-owned gaming experience.\nOur Core Architecture: Dedicated Smart Contracts and The Alith Framework\nThe true innovation behind Fracture Point lies in its robust, interconnected smart contracts and the strategic implementation of the Alith Architecture.\n1. The Alith Architecture: Our Tailored Blockchain Game Framework\nFracture Point leverages a bespoke implementation of the Alith Architecture. This is our comprehensive, modular framework meticulously designed to seamlessly integrate blockchain technology without compromising gameplay performance. It intelligently separates:\nOn-Chain Components: Our smart contracts (FPToken, RankBadge, ClaimManager) handle critical, immutable data like XP (FPToken) balances, Rank Badge (NFT) ownership, and verifiable achievements. This ensures decentralization, security, and provable ownership. The Alith Oracle acts as the trusted off-chain authority that bridges game outcomes to on-chain actions, such as distributing XP and authorizing badge claims.\nOff-Chain Backend: High-frequency game logic, real-time matchmaking, complex physics calculations, and volatile player statistics run on a performant off-chain backend. This guarantees a smooth, low-latency, and responsive gameplay experience, unburdened by blockchain transaction times and gas costs.\nSecure Interoperability: A robust and auditable communication layer ensures seamless and secure data flow between our contracts (governed by the Alith Oracle) and the off-chain game server.\n2. Fracture Point\u2019s Core Smart Contracts (Audited & Interconnected)\nWe have successfully designed, developed, and prepared for deployment the foundational smart contracts that power Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 economy and the Proof of Play mechanics. These contracts work in concert:\nFPToken.sol (FuturePoint Token) : This ERC-20 token represents XP within the Fracture Point ecosystem. It\u2019s designed specifically for in-game progression:\nMinted by Alith Oracle: Only the designated alithOracle can mint new FPToken to players (e.g., via distributeRiftXP) based on game outcomes.\nBurned by ClaimManager: The ClaimManager contract is uniquely authorized to burn FPToken (XP) from player balances when they claim Rank Badges, creating a clear utility and economic loop.\nNon-Transferable (Player-to-Player): Significantly, direct player-to-player transfers of FPToken are disabled. This ensures FPToken remains a pure XP/progression token, preventing speculative trading and focusing its value on in-game achievement.\nRankBadge.sol (Fracture Point Rank Badge) : This ERC-721 NFT contract represents unique, season-specific Rank Badges that players can earn.\nMinted by ClaimManager: Only the ClaimManager contract is authorized to mint new Rank Badges to players, ensuring badges are earned through the proper Proof of Play mechanism.\nImmutable On-Chain Proof: Each badge is a unique NFT, providing verifiable, immutable proof of a player\u2019s achievement for a given season and rank.\nClaimManager.sol : This is the central orchestrator contract, linking FPToken (XP) to Rank Badges (NFTs) and acting as the bridge to the Alith Oracle.\nManages Badge Claims: Players claim badges via ClaimManager, which then verifies their XP balance, burns the necessary FPToken from their account, and instructs RankBadge.sol to mint the new NFT.\nSeason Management: It tracks the currentSeason, ensuring players can only claim one badge per season.\nKarma Evaluation Requests: It facilitates requests for off-chain \u201cKarma\u201d evaluations by the Alith Oracle, hinting at deeper player behavior analysis.\nAlith Oracle Integration: It designates and relies on the alithOracle for authorizing badge claims and distributing rewards based on verified game data.\nThe code for these foundational contracts and the full Alith Architecture implementation can be reviewed in our public repository: https://github.com/SUPAMAN-dev/fracture-point-hyperhack\nYou can also verify our currently deployed contract addresses on the Hyperion testnet network: https://hyperion-testnet.metisdevops.link/\nFPToken Address: 0x4D23a7A2231624F1486CE0dE07C2fbF002f751B9\nClaimManager Address: 0x1Dab96d049e3ce56D51e6B0b149477927B897FFb\nRankBadge Address: 0xBB84D771f6aef01f00dEE45D9C9dF9C7ef9159e5\n(Note on GHC: While not currently on-chain, the fixed supply GHC currency, managed by multisig, will form the broader economic layer of Fracture Point. Its design ensures seamless future integration with our on-chain systems when the time is right, complementing the FPToken XP system.)\nLobby Prototype: The Player\u2019s Interactive Gateway\nComplementing this powerful blockchain backend, our functional lobby prototype provides the intuitive player-facing interface. It allows players to:\nSeamlessly navigate between game modes, customization options, and personal profiles.\nExperience a polished UI/UX that aligns with Fracture Point\u2019s futuristic theme.\nInteract with the foundational elements for future wallet integration, demonstrating how players will connect their on-chain assets to the game.\nLink to the prototype demo: https://youtu.be/aI_lQ6DcwEI\nEcosystem Interest: Strategic Offer from Plurality Web3\nAs a direct result of our development efforts during this Hyperion Hackathon, Fracture Point attracted partnership interest from leading Web3 infrastructure teams, most notably Plurality Web3, a startup pioneering embedded identity and authentication infrastructure for dApps.\nPlurality offered us a 12-month support package under their Partner Program, which includes:\n1:1 Engineering Support for seamless integration of user authentication and personalized in-game logic.\nFree infrastructure credits to cover authentication, user session tooling, and zkTLS-powered identity gating.\nUX Collaboration to co-design smooth onboarding flows without popups or clunky wallets particularly valuable for our casual-to-core player conversion goals.\nTheir outreach came after they reviewed Fracture Point\u2019s Hyperion-backed Proof of Play system and saw clear potential for adoption in competitive Web3 gaming.\nWe view this offer as both validation of our underlying architecture and a strategic complement to the low-cost, high-throughput infrastructure that Hyperion enables. These ecosystem synergies affirm that Fracture Point is not just a playable demo, but a platform being taken seriously by early infrastructure players.\nWhat\u2019s Next for Fracture Point?\nWith the core blockchain architecture, smart contracts, and the lobby interface firmly established, our immediate next steps are to integrate these powerful systems with the actual game engine to bring the full combat experience to life. This includes:\nBackend Game Logic Development: Building out the sophisticated off-chain systems for real-time matchmaking, secure player data management, and robust anti-cheat measures.\nGame Engine Integration: Connecting the lobby and backend systems to a game engine to render the immersive world and high-fidelity combat of Fracture Point.\nProof of Play Loop Refinement: Fully integrating in-game actions with our GameAchievementRegistry.sol via the Alith Oracle to ensure every skill-based action is verifiable and contributes to player progression and potential future GHC earnings.\nThis is an incredibly exciting time for Fracture Point.

                "comment": "Thanks for the kind words! Really appreciate the interest and great question.\nAt its core, Fracture Point is about creating a truly fair and transparent gaming ecosystem, where skill and effort are what get rewarded, not exploits or shortcuts.\nThat\u2019s exactly where Alith comes in.\nIn a typical game, especially online shooters, you always run into players who cheat, farm, or abuse systems to win. That destroys trust. What we\u2019re doing differently in Fracture Point is putting integrity at the heart of our reward system.\nAlith acts as the intelligent game moderator. It monitors every match every Rift through the Unity backend, evaluating outcomes, watching for exploits, and making sure only fair wins are rewarded. No shady leaderboard climbs. No rigged XP farming.\nThen, using its special permissions (as the alithOracle in our ClaimManager contract), Alith sends reward signals on-chain, issuing XP (FPToken) to players who truly earned them. That XP can then be used to claim seasonal badges and other progression rewards all verifiable and immutable.\nOver time, Alith learns from gameplay, gets smarter at spotting abusers, and helps us maintain a competitive but honest battlefield.\nThis is the first real merge of Web2-style live gameplay with Web3 reward mechanics, and we\u2019re doing it in a way that makes sense to real players. We want trust, transparency, and fun and Alith helps make that possible."

That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done with the prototype so far.\nWe\u2019re still a small team and looking for more developers to help bring the combat experience to life, especially engine-side. If you or anyone you know is excited by that vision, we\u2019d love to collaborate even sharing our project with friends helps a lot. Your support, both in words and connections, means everything at this stage."

                "comment": "Awesome summary of how AI is transforming operations, and a great question.\nI believe nothing will ever replace genuine, authentic human judgment when it comes to organizing a project\u2019s work. But AI is an incredibly powerful tool that makes our work more efficient, faster, and easier. For me, it\u2019s a huge time-saver and an always-available assistant, even when a crazy idea pops into my head in the middle of the night, I can instantly ask AI whether it\u2019s feasible.\nNothing can replace human-to-human interaction, with all the empathy and nuance it brings. But embracing AI as a tool to support your work can make your job smoother and a lot more enjoyable.\nAs I mentioned, one of the ways I use AI in my workflow is by sharing all possible information about the project and regularly discussing new features, updates, and any issues that arise. Over time, as it learns this context, AI becomes an even better and more effective assistant. In a way, we learn from each other."

                "comment": "This resonates deeply with me, especially around non-violent communication. AI has become my go-to tool for reframing thoughts that might come across as judgmental or confrontational. We\u2019re all raised with \u201cviolent communication\u201d patterns - the constant framing of right vs wrong, good vs bad - and it\u2019s so deeply embedded that we don\u2019t even notice it.\nHaving AI help translate ideas into more collaborative language has been transformative. Instead of saying \u201cthis approach is wrong,\u201d I can explore \u201chere\u2019s another perspective to consider.\u201d It\u2019s like having a communication coach that helps you embody better principles in real-time.\nBeyond communication, AI has revolutionized my operational workflow. It parses meeting notes to extract actionable tasks, troubleshoots technical configurations that used to require specialists, and catches details I would have missed. What used to take hours of coordination now happens in minutes.\nBut here\u2019s what I find most valuable: AI as a source of inspiration and perspective. Because it has access to such diverse knowledge, it surfaces approaches and viewpoints that wouldn\u2019t naturally occur to me. It helps break me out of my usual thinking patterns and consider challenges from angles I might never have explored.\nThe philosophical implications are fascinating too. When we use AI to enhance our communication and thinking, we\u2019re essentially creating space for more thoughtful, less reactive responses. That\u2019s fundamentally about becoming better humans, not just more efficient operators.\nGreat article\n@CrisMetis\n!"

Shifted my mindset\nFrom \u201cquick cash grab\u201d \u2192 to building a startup that creates long-term sustainable value & income.\n2. Launched my Twitter + started building in public\nShowed up every day. Shared progress.\nThis is my first step into real startup marketing.\n3. Explored tons of ideas \u2192 picked one that clicks\nThe one that excites me. The one I want to wake up for.\n4. Designed first UI mockups\nGot the visual side of the product moving. First screen = first step to real product.\n5. Understood the tech architecture\nHow everything connects: smart contracts, data flows, frontend logic.\n6. Learned by walking in the user\u2019s shoes\nI tried trading perps.\nI tried providing liquidity.\nNow I feel what my user needs. That\u2019s gold.\n7. Made big tech decisions\nAfter deep research, I chose GMX V1 as the base. It\u2019s stable, simple, well-documented. Perfect for MVP.\n8. Realized the scale of the journey\nIt\u2019s long.\nIt\u2019s exciting.\nAnd I\u2019m all in.\nWhat went well:\nI made decisions with clarity\nI worked on my mindset\nI found a vision that gives me fire in the eyes\nMistakes I made:\nDived too deep into tech too early\nShould\u2019ve explored UX flows & user journey before obsessing over smart contracts.\nPlan for next week (week 2):\nFocus hard on the technical build:\n\u2013 Build a simple frontend to open positions\n\u2013 Dive deep into smart contract structure\n\u2013 Connect frontend + contracts on Arbitrum testnet\nIdeal outcome = MVP skeleton working.\nThanks to everyone who\u2019s followed this journey so far.\nNow it\u2019s time to breathe, reset, and get ready for WEEK 2.\nLet\u2019s keep building"

                "comment": "This sounds like a really interesting project, Tony! The concept of turning crypto trading into a fighting game with real-time simulation and on-chain verification is quite innovative.\nHere are a few thoughts and potential discussion points for you, based on your post:\nMetis Hyperion Integration: You mentioned deploying your first on-chain logic using Metis\u2019s Hyperion. This is a great way to leverage the speed and security of the Metis L2 network. I\u2019m curious about what specific gameplay elements you plan to make cryptographically verifiable. Are you thinking about verifiable randomness for match outcomes, or perhaps on-chain escrow for in-game assets?\nCommunity Engagement: The leaderboards, referral system, and missions are excellent for driving user engagement. Have you considered any tokenomics or NFT integration strategies to further incentivize participation and long-term retention?\nTechnical Challenges: Transitioning from a Telegram Mini App to a full web app while maintaining real-time gameplay and integrating on-chain mechanics sounds technically challenging. What are some of the biggest hurdles you\u2019re anticipating, and how are you planning to address them?\nI\u2019d also recommend sharing this project in the #ideation channel on the LazAI Discord. There are a lot of knowledgeable people there who could provide valuable feedback and suggestions.\nTo find the discord, you can use this search query: LazAI Discord"

Decentralized doesn\u2019t mean unfiltered.\nAttribution is a Nightmare\nHow do we accurately track which datasets directly influenced a model\u2019s output especially in multi-source training scenarios? Without granular attribution, revenue-sharing quickly becomes speculative or unfair.\nGaming the System\nTokenized rewards always open the door to manipulation. Think botnets uploading synthetic data or feedback loops designed solely to trigger payout thresholds. This needs aggressive prevention design.\nLegal & Ethical Landmines\nIf a user uploads copyrighted or sensitive data, who\u2019s liable? The protocol? The contributors? The downstream AI project? Decentralization doesn\u2019t erase legal responsibility.\nRevenue Distribution Models Are Still Vague\nHow exactly will revenue be split between thousands of contributors? Based on access? Utility? Frequency of use?

Sports betting AI would definitely benefit from DATs, you could access real-time injury reports, fan insights, weather data, social sentiment, and local news that traditional expensive data feeds miss. The tricky part is ensuring data quality since bad info costs real money in betting, plus you\u2019d need lightning-fast verification for time-sensitive updates like last-minute player changes. The financial incentives could also create serious gaming risks with fake reports or manipulated sentiment. But if you can solve the quality control and real-time verification challenges, you\u2019d have access to way more comprehensive data than what\u2019s currently available. What specific data gaps are you seeing that existing sources don\u2019t cover well?"

It aims to solve a real problem in the decentralized AI space by providing a standardized way to monetize AI models, APIs, and MCP servers. The integration with Alith for conversational discovery and usage is a great feature. The gamified AI economy campaign is also a clever way to encourage adoption and experimentation.\nA few questions/thoughts:\nSmart Contract Details: What blockchain(s) are the smart contracts deployed on? Are there any specific gas optimization techniques being used, considering the per-request payment model?\nPricing Flexibility: The description mentions \u201cper-call, per-token, tiered billing.\u201d Can you elaborate on the types of tiered billing supported?\nSecurity Considerations: What security measures are in place to prevent abuse or malicious usage of the monetized endpoints?\nOpen Source: When will the GitHub repository be available?\nI think this project has the potential to significantly contribute to the Hyperion ecosystem by enabling a more sustainable and scalable model for decentralized AI development."

To keep gas costs low, we use the minimal-proxy pattern (EIP-1167) to spin up new wrappers in a few hundred bytes, and we batch-update usage counters instead of writing to storage on every single call.\n2. Pricing Flexibility\nYou can choose any mix of:\nFlat per-call fees (e.g. 0.01 METIS each)\nCredit-based billing, where you buy tokens or credits that get burned as you consume resources\nTiered or subscription plans, like volume discounts (first 10 calls at 0.01 METIS, next 90 at 0.008) or prepaid blocks of calls at a reduced rate.\n3. Security Considerations\nWe\u2019ve built in several safeguards:\nPrepaid deposits so you can\u2019t run up an unexpected bill\nChecks-effects-interactions and OpenZeppelin libraries to avoid reentrancy and other pitfalls\nOn-chain rate limits or quotas per user or API key\nAn emergency \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d to pause a service if something looks fishy.\n4. Open Source\nThe GitHub repo goes live in about two weeks. We\u2019ll open the contracts, playground UI, and Alith integration code \u2014and welcome your PRs, issues, and \u201cFounding Contributor\u201d badges from release Day."

Retail investors struggle to keep up with rapidly changing market conditions and protocols, leading to suboptimal yield and high risks. There\u2019s a need for a system that automates intelligent yield allocation while remaining transparent, secure, and accessible.\nSolution Overview\niYield is an on-chain AI-powered vault protocol that automates capital allocation across yield strategies. Leveraging Hyperion\u2019s parallel execution and on-chain AI capabilities, iYield dynamically rebalances funds across multiple DeFi protocols to optimize returns. Our system democratizes advanced yield optimization, removing the barrier of technical know-how while ensuring transparency and performance. By bringing AI workflows directly on-chain, iYield introduces fully verifiable, trustless DeFi asset management for everyone.\nProject Description\niYield is a modular DeFAI protocol offering Smart Vaults, AI-driven investment vaults that manage yield strategies in real-time. It uses a rebalancing engine built on on-chain AI models to evaluate yield rates, risk metrics, gas costs, and liquidity across various DeFi protocols. Users deposit into Smart Vaults, which then allocate funds automatically based on performance and risk profiles determined by the AI.\nWe plan to leverage Hyperion\u2019s high-throughput parallel execution, real-time inference for LLMs, and Optimistic Rollup support to enable seamless AI decision-making directly on-chain. Core features will include vault creation, AI strategy selection, real-time performance analytics, and dynamic allocation. What excites us is the possibility of making DeFi investment smarter, faster, and fairer thus empowering users with minimal effort and maximum transparency.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nTo incentivize engagement, iYield will integrate a gamified testnet experience:\nTestable Tasks: Deposit into a Super Vault, simulate a rebalancing operation, vote on a community strategy proposal, and complete an educational quiz.\nPoints System: Each task earns users points (e.g., Deposit = 20 pts, Rebalance Sim = 30 pts, Vote = 15 pts, Quiz = 10 pts).\nGamification Mechanics: Leaderboards, NFT badges for milestones, and early-user rewards tied to accumulated points.\nGetting Involved\nCommunity members can join via:\nDiscord/Telegram: Contribute feedback, ideas, and test features.\nGitHub: Collaborate on smart contract development or audit code.\nContent Creation: Help with educational materials, documentation, or translations.\nEarly Access: Sign up as a beta tester to help shape iYield and earn rewards.\nMORE INFO SOON",

However, what sets iYield apart is our Autopilot feature, a layer powered by AI agents with distinct behavioral traits like Predictive Learner, Short-Term Flipper, Long-Term Holder, Yield DCA Agent, Stablecoin Maximalist.\nThese AI agents analyze user manual/on-chain activity patterns and leverage trained data models to:\nAutomatically allocate user capital to the most optimal Vaults/Pools (if Autopilot is fully enabled).\nSuggest the best strategies for manual selection (if Autopilot is partially enabled).\nThis allows users to benefit from personalized, data-driven yield optimization without needing deep DeFi expertise.\nNon-Custodial by Design\nYes, the iYield protocol is fully non-custodial. Users retain control over their funds at all times. Deposits and withdrawals can be made directly from Vaults/Pools at any time \u2014 we never take ownership or custody of user assets."

While our AI agents assist with portfolio decisions, users can set explicit preferences to control what the Smart Vault is allowed to do.\nFor example, a user might permit their Smart Vault to automatically exit positions when risk thresholds are breached, but require manual approval for new deposits.\nThis hybrid model ensures that users remain in control while still benefiting from intelligent automation.\nWe\u2019re also exploring additional risk management features, such as customizable risk-reward ratios. While risk can\u2019t be completely eliminated, we aim to minimize it as much as possible.\nEach AI agent is defined by a set of traits, and each trait carries a specific risk factor. Based on this, users can assess the cumulative risk of their Smart Vaults and make informed decisions."

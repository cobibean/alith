Matchmaking and the PvP Challenge\nSince the game is PvP, the main challenge is matchmaking. If a player creates a game and no one joins \u2014 that\u2019s a blocker, especially during the early stages of the project when user activity is low.\nTo solve this, we developed a matchmaking bot that plays by trading using AI. It acts as a kind of agent filling the role of an opponent.\nRepo:\ngithub.com\nGitHub - MortalCoin/mortalcoin_alith_bot: MortalCoin\u2019s AI playing bot makes decisions using...\nMortalCoin\u2019s AI playing bot makes decisions using the Alith AI Agent.\nThe bot constantly monitors the matchmaking lobby, joins open games, listens to the ongoing game state (real-time prices, opponent actions, etc.), and tries to make good decisions based on its assigned role.\n2. Price Feeds and Market Simulation\nAnother major challenge is the price feed. To make the game fun, prices must move often enough and reflect meaningful market behavior \u2014 while remaining accurate.\nTechnically, it\u2019s possible to integrate real asset trading instead of paper trading, but:\nIt complicates the game and pushes it toward being more of a gamified trading wrapper (not necessarily bad \u2014 could be explored separately)\nIt requires a liquid perpetual market to support both long and short positions\nPrices must be reliable and update on very short timeframes (e.g., per second or even tick-level)\nWe haven\u2019t found a suitable decentralized solution suitable for POC (like an oracle refreshing fast enough), so for testnet we built our own market-making bot that simulates price movement on AMM DEX pairs - effectively acting as an in-house oracle.\nRepo:\ngithub.com\nGitHub - MortalCoin/mortalcoin-dex-bot\nContribute to MortalCoin/mortalcoin-dex-bot development by creating an account on GitHub.\n3. Gameplay Depth via Hidden Information\nI wanted to make the game interesting, adding elements of partially hidden information, similar to poker. If all variables are visible \u2014 current price, realized PnL, positions (yours and your opponent\u2019s) \u2014 it turns into a deterministic equation-solving task rather than a game.\nSo, in MortalCoin, you only know whether the opponent has opened a position \u2014 but not the direction (long or short). This creates tension and strategy.\nTo support this, we implemented a system where positions are hashed with a backend key before being sent on-chain. The flow is:\nPlayer sends an EIP-712 object with position details to the backend\nBackend hashes the position and signs it\nPlayer submits the hashed version to the smart contract\nDirection is only revealed when the player closes the position\nThis prevents sniping and adds a layer of strategy.\n4. Incomplete Games and Forced Finalization\nOne more big challenge: non-finished games, whether abandoned on purpose or due to connection loss.\nThe contract calculates PnL based on the price at the time of position closing, which opens a potential exploit where a malicious player might avoid closing their position to lock in a win or deny the opponent\u2019s reward.\nTo prevent this, we added a forceFinish function to the contract. Our backend watcher monitors all ongoing games and triggers forceFinish for any game that wasn\u2019t completed in time.\nIt was also tricky to implement a reliable system for storing nonces and direction data on the backend side, so we could finalize games even when one player is unresponsive.\nGame Flow: Sequence Diagram\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nWe\u2019re just getting started!\nAlpha Testing (ETA: August)\nPolish all layers, pay off technical debt, and prepare for community testing (small events with $ rewards).\nBeta Testing (ETA: September \u2013 October)\nLaunch the first tournament with real, bigger prizes and continue collecting feedback.\nMainnet Launch (ETA: December \u2013 January)\nHuge tournament event (with seasons, ELO rankings, and leagues), plus Gleam, Galxe & Layer3 campaigns, and paid ads to amplify everything!",

        "content": "On August 19th, the Metis community hosted an AMA with Daniel Kwak, CCO of Metis and Head of Marketing for LazAI. The session shed light on Metis\u2019 ecosystem direction, the LazAI testnet launch, and what lies ahead for Hyperion and Andromeda.\nKey Highlights\n1. Metis Beyond \u201cJust Another L2\u201d\nDaniel emphasised that Metis isn\u2019t positioning itself as another scaling solution, but as an innovation hub. From ZKM pushing zero-knowledge advancements to GOAT Network in Bitcoin L2 and LazAI pioneering AI x blockchain, Metis is focused on building the next step solutions.\nTakeaway: Metis differentiates by innovating across new frontiers, not just competing in the L2 race.\n2. Growth Drivers: Hyperion + LazAI\nHyperion and LazAI were highlighted as the flagship pillars driving ecosystem growth. Together, they bring AI, data, and agent economies on-chain, expanding the AI+blockchain market rather than merely entering it.\nOther initiatives, like the Korean baseball partnership and upcoming collaborations with official organisations and companies, signal broader adoption beyond traditional Web3 circles.\n3.

                "comment": "On August 19th, the Metis community hosted an AMA with Daniel Kwak, CCO of Metis and Head of Marketing for LazAI. The session shed light on Metis\u2019 ecosystem direction, the LazAI testnet launch, and what lies ahead for Hyperion and Andromeda.\nKey Highlights\n1. Metis Beyond \u201cJust Another L2\u201d\nDaniel emphasised that Metis isn\u2019t positioning itself as another scaling solution, but as an innovation hub. From ZKM pushing zero-knowledge advancements to GOAT Network in Bitcoin L2 and LazAI pioneering AI x blockchain, Metis is focused on building the next step solutions.\nTakeaway: Metis differentiates by innovating across new frontiers, not just competing in the L2 race.\n2. Growth Drivers: Hyperion + LazAI\nHyperion and LazAI were highlighted as the flagship pillars driving ecosystem growth. Together, they bring AI, data, and agent economies on-chain, expanding the AI+blockchain market rather than merely entering it.\nOther initiatives, like the Korean baseball partnership and upcoming collaborations with official organisations and companies, signal broader adoption beyond traditional Web3 circles.\n3. Andromeda + Hyperion Synergy\nBoth networks serve different markets, but value flows back into the same ecosystem.

Manual trading is emotionally taxing, requires constant market monitoring, and demands technical analysis skills many users lack. Additionally, traders struggle to maintain consistent strategies, often shifting approaches based on emotion rather than data, leading to suboptimal results.\nSolution Overview\nLazaiTrader is an intelligent multi-agent trading system accessible through Telegram that allows users to select specialized AI trading personas, each with distinct strategies and risk profiles. The system continuously analyzes market conditions and either generates actionable buy/sell signals or automatically executes trades across major DEXs based on user preference.\nBuilt on the same robust Alith framework infrastructure and a privacy-preserving Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), LazaiTrader adapts to market conditions while maintaining the user\u2019s selected trading philosophy, effectively bringing institutional-grade trading strategies to retail users through a familiar messaging interface.\nThrough deep integration with the Lazai Network, users can securely contribute their private trading data and configurations, which are stored in a TEE and become part of a collective knowledge base. The system then provides personalized analysis and recommendations by comparing user performance against this anonymized collective data, ensuring privacy while delivering data-backed insights that improve trading outcomes for the entire community.\nProject Description\nLazaiTrader transforms crypto trading by allowing users to select from various AI trading personas, each representing different trading philosophies and strategies. Whether you prefer momentum trading, swing trading, technical analysis, or contrarian approaches, LazaiTrader provides a suite of specialized AI agents to match your preferred style.\nCore Features\nPersona Selection System: Allows users to choose trading philosophies that match their temperament\nStrategy Visualization: Shows potential entry/exit points before execution\nDual-Mode Operation: Offers either signal-only notifications or fully automated trade execution\nStrategy Vault: Securely analyzes trading data with AI to offer personalized crypto strategy improvement suggestions.\nThe system leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) technology and a decentralized Strategy Vault, enabled by the Lazai network, to maintain a coherent understanding across interactions, remembering user preferences, portfolio composition, and past decisions.\nTrading Infrastructure\nThe platform is currently optimized for agentic trading on our own custom-built DEX with a private oracle solution. On production, we will enable trading on HerculesDEX to provide access to its deep liquidity on Metis. Our future roadmap includes a direct integration with Binance, which is ready for deployment but will be released later to allow for a more elaborate user onboarding process.\nAdvanced Trading Algorithms\nOur algorithms move beyond traditional indicators like moving averages which might not be as reliable in volatile crypto markets. Instead, we use:\nMomentum-based strategies that capitalize on emerging trends before they become obvious\nVolatility-adaptive approaches that dynamically adjust position sizes based on market conditions\nLiquidity flow analysis to identify smart money movements before price reacts\nTrading Personas\nUsers can select specific asset-focused strategies including:\nBlue Chip Trader: Focusing on BTC, ETH, METIS and other established cryptocurrencies\nMicro Cap Trader: For those seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in emerging tokens\nEach persona combines these strategy elements differently based on their trading philosophy.\nUser Experience\nUsers interact with the system through a telegram interface that explains complex trading strategies in accessible terms tailored to each user\u2019s demonstrated technical understanding. What makes LazaiTrader particularly valuable is its recognition that bull markets favor active trading strategies rather than passive yield farming approaches, allowing users to capitalize on market momentum through their preferred trading style.\nStrategy Vault\nA new feature, the \u201cStrategy Vault,\u201d allows users to securely contribute their trading data and configuration. This data, signed with the user\u2019s wallet and stored in a TEE on the Lazai network, becomes part of a collective knowledge base.

Students and educators face the challenge of a rigid system that doesn\u2019t adapt to diverse needs, impacting learning outcomes.\nSolution Overview\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform offers a dynamic solution by employing a multi-agent system built on the Alith Agentic Framework. Specialized AI agents collaboratively analyze individual learning styles, curate tailored content, provide adaptive tutoring, and track progress in real time. This creates a uniquely personalized learning journey that adjusts to each student\u2019s needs and pace. By integrating diverse educational resources, the platform aims to enhance engagement, improve learning outcomes, and empower both students and educators.\nProject Description\nThis platform is designed to benefit a wide range of users across the educational landscape. Students of all ages, from kindergarten through higher education, can experience a more engaging and effective learning journey tailored to their specific needs. Educators can utilize the platform to enhance their teaching capabilities, gain deeper insights into student progress, and free up time for more individualized support.\nOn-Chain Components: A First-Class Implementation and Core Requirement for Blockchain Deployment\nOur AI-powered personalized education platform is not merely \u201cblockchain-enhanced\u201d \u2014 its core functionality and unique value proposition depend fundamentally on blockchain deployment via Hyperion. The decentralized, trustless, and immutable nature of blockchain\u2014particularly Hyperion\u2019s AI-optimized environment\u2014is essential to realizing our vision.\nOn-Chain Achievement Verification (Smart Contract Architecture)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain:\nThe LearningRecord.sol smart contract serves as an immutable, on-chain ledger for all student accomplishments.\nAchievement Mapping: The contract maintains a mapping from a user\u2019s wallet address to an array of Achievement structs, where each struct contains the moduleName and a timestamp.\nSecure, Off-Chain Verification: A secure, server-controlled wallet is the only address authorized to call the addAchievementWithSignature function. This ensures achievements are only recorded after the platform\u2019s backend has verified the user\u2019s quiz completion and signature.\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nTrustless & Immutable Credentials: By recording achievements on the Metis Hyperion testnet, we create a permanent, tamper-proof record of learning that is owned by the user and verifiable by anyone (e.g., employers, other institutions) without relying on a centralized database.\nData Sovereignty: Students retain full control of their learning data. On-chain metadata ensures ownership and transparency, unlike siloed centralized platforms.\nFoundation for a Trustless Ecosystem: This on-chain record is the foundational layer. While AI agents currently operate off-chain for performance, their most critical output\u2014the certification of learning\u2014is secured on the blockchain.\nAI Enablement via the Alith Agentic Framework\nWhat is Alith:\nAlith is a modular, multi-agent framework designed to power personalized learning by simulating human-like reasoning, memory, and collaboration among AI agents. It forms the intelligence layer of our platform, with deep interoperability with blockchain systems like Hyperion.\nKey Features of Alith (Implemented):\nAgent Management: Modular deployment of specialized AI agents:\nLearning Style Analyst (Implicit in course selection)\nContent Curator (AI Study Guide Generator)\nPersonalized Tutor (Quiz Hints & Tutor Chat)\nProgress Tracker (On-chain achievement logging)\nPersistent Memory: Agents maintain long-term memory and context across sessions (demonstrated in Telegram bot), enhancing personalization.\nToolchain Access: Seamless access to external APIs and knowledge bases for generating content and hints.\nBlockchain Integration with Alith:\nThe Alith agent framework operates off-chain to provide a responsive and intelligent user experience. The blockchain is used as the ultimate source of truth for the results of these AI interactions.\nVerifiable Outcomes: When a user successfully passes a quiz, the off-chain backend coordinates with the ProgressTrackerAgent to commit this achievement to the LearningRecord smart contract, creating an immutable record\u2705.\nFoundation for On-Chain Logic: The current architecture provides the groundwork for future enhancements where agent workflows could be triggered and validated by smart contracts.\nSecure, Real-Time AI Inference (Leveraging Hyperion\u2019s AI-Native Infrastructure)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain (or Hyperion-enabled):\nWhile heavy AI workloads (e.g., model training, long-form inference) run off-chain via the Alith framework, Hyperion enables:\nVerifiable AI Outputs: AI-driven assessments and tutor recommendations are validated off-chain, with the final \u201cproof-of-completion\u201d immutably stored on-chain. This ensures educational integrity and transparency\u2014unlike opaque, centralized AI systems.\nLow Latency, High Throughput: Hyperion\u2019s parallel execution environment supports the fast transaction finality needed to record achievements in near real-time, keeping learners engaged.\nData Sovereignty, Incentives, and Trust in Our Education Platform\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform leverages Hyperion\u2019s blockchain to give students true control over their learning data and foster a trusted educational environment.\nWallet-Based Identity and User Control\nIn our platform, a user\u2019s Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) serves as their identity. Authentication is handled securely via message signing, ensuring users control access to their accounts without traditional passwords. This wallet-centric approach is the first step toward a future of true data sovereignty, where learning profiles can be fully controlled by the user.\nImportance of Trust and Transparency\nIn education, trust and transparency are paramount:\nLearner Trust: Students need to trust that their achievements are real. On-chain verifiable credentials build this crucial trust.\nEmpowering Educators: Transparent data provides educators with reliable insights into student progress and curriculum effectiveness.\nEquity & Accessibility: Blockchain prevents fraud and offers a universal, trusted way for students to showcase skills, democratizing opportunities regardless of background.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nPeer Study Groups: Connect with others for collaborative discussions and support.\nQ&A Forums: Ask and answer subject-related questions to deepen understanding.\nSimulated Collaboration: Practice teamwork in virtual, project-based learning scenarios.\nOptional Mentorship: Receive guidance from experienced peers and educators.\nProgress Sharing (Privacy-Controlled): Share milestones to motivate peers while maintaining control over visibility.\nCommunity Challenges: Participate in gamified group activities to promote engagement and friendly competition.\nFuture Roadmap & Planned Enhancements\nThis MVP is the foundation for a much larger vision. Our planned enhancements include:\nToken-Based Incentives ($LP)\nIntroduce a utility token, LearnPoints ($LP), to create a Learn-to-Earn (L2E) model that rewards students for completing modules, mastering skills, and contributing to the community.\n$LP could be staked for premium features or used to vote on platform decisions, aligning community interests.\nDecentralized Agent Marketplace\nAllow community developers to contribute new agents (e.g., specialized tutors or regional content curators).\nAgents will be published and authenticated on-chain with verifiable capabilities.\nToken-based reputation and staking mechanisms will prevent misuse or malicious behavior.\nOn-Chain Agent Coordination & Composable Workflows\nEvolve our smart contract architecture to manage agent workflows directly, enabling fully trustless and transparent educational logic.\nEnable educators to compose reusable learning workflows by chaining agents together via simple declarative schemas, backed by on-chain validation.\nZK-Verifiable Inference\nIntegrate zkML (zero-knowledge machine learning) to enable cryptographic verification of off-chain AI outputs. This allows validators and institutions to confirm an agent\u2019s decision (e.g., a test score) without exposing the underlying model or input.\nMultilingual & Accessibility Agents\nCreate plug-and-play AI agents specialized in localization, translation, and neurodiverse learning strategies.\nTeam Members\n@amardeep\n@priyankg3\nGitHub\ngithub.com\nGitHub - amardeepio/Eduverse\nContribute to amardeepio/Eduverse development by creating an account on GitHub.\nVideo tutorial EduVerse tutorial video\nPresentation and future roadmap: Presentation and RoadMap",

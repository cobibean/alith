The platform blends meme culture with playful earning mechanics like the Degen Wheel and Wheel of Fortune, creating a lighthearted and community-first experience. With no KYC requirements, simple interfaces, and real token payouts, Froska brings back the fun in crypto\u2014while giving meme tokens actual purpose.\nWe are now moving to Hyperion to take advantage of its speed and AI-native infrastructure, introducing smart features that will evolve Froska from a meme-based game into an intelligent, interactive crypto arcade.\nProject Description\nFroska is a gamified crypto experience built around chance-based games and meme culture. Players can spin the Wheel of Fortune for varying rewards or risk it all on the Degen Wheel, a high-risk game for thrill-seeking degens.

We combine both in a simple way. Froska is a meme token with actual use. You spin, earn, and repeat. It\u2019s made for casual users.\nThe Wheel of Fortune gives you a reward every time. It\u2019s low risk. The Degen Wheel is for higher risk. You stake tokens, spin, and either win a multiplier or lose the stake. The games are fast and don\u2019t require any technical background.\nWe\u2019re moving to Hyperion for two reasons. One is speed. Spins and outcomes happen instantly. The other is AI. We\u2019re adding an in-game AI assistant. It will guide new users, explain gameplay, and help them explore features. Hyperion makes that possible. Andromeda doesn\u2019t."

                "comment": "Yep.\nThe AI assistant will adapt over time. It will observe on-chain behavior, like how often you play, how much you stake, and what games you prefer. From that, it will group users into simple profiles\u2014cautious, moderate, or degen. Each group will get tailored prompts.\nA cautious player might get tips on low-risk spins or claim reminders.\nA degen might get high-risk challenges or bonus rounds. The goal is to keep every user engaged without forcing one play style."

No inflation, no constant minting. Long-term engagement comes from light incentives, social interaction, and meme culture not oversized rewards."

        "content": "EduVerse: AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform\nProblem Statement\nStandardized education overlooks individual learning styles and paces, leading to disengagement and hindering student potential. Students and educators face the challenge of a rigid system that doesn\u2019t adapt to diverse needs, impacting learning outcomes.\nSolution Overview\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform offers a dynamic solution by employing a multi-agent system built on the Alith Agentic Framework. Specialized AI agents collaboratively analyze individual learning styles, curate tailored content, provide adaptive tutoring, and track progress in real time. This creates a uniquely personalized learning journey that adjusts to each student\u2019s needs and pace. By integrating diverse educational resources, the platform aims to enhance engagement, improve learning outcomes, and empower both students and educators.\nProject Description\nThis platform is designed to benefit a wide range of users across the educational landscape. Students of all ages, from kindergarten through higher education, can experience a more engaging and effective learning journey tailored to their specific needs. Educators can utilize the platform to enhance their teaching capabilities, gain deeper insights into student progress, and free up time for more individualized support.\nOn-Chain Components: A First-Class Implementation and Core Requirement for Blockchain Deployment\nOur AI-powered personalized education platform is not merely \u201cblockchain-enhanced\u201d \u2014 its core functionality and unique value proposition depend fundamentally on blockchain deployment via Hyperion. The decentralized, trustless, and immutable nature of blockchain\u2014particularly Hyperion\u2019s AI-optimized environment\u2014is essential to realizing our vision.\nVerifiable and Immutable Learning Profiles (On-Chain Data Storage)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain:\nStudent learning profiles\u2014containing hashed learning milestones, verified skills, and personalized path progress\u2014are recorded on Hyperion\u2019s MetisDB. Each profile includes:\nA unique student identifier\nImmutable logs of achievements\nReferences to off-chain AI agent interactions and curated learning content\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nTrustless Verification:\nCentralized educational records are prone to tampering and lack transparency. On-chain profiles offer tamper-proof, auditable records of a learner\u2019s journey\u2014verifiable by students, employers, and academic institutions alike.\nData Sovereignty:\nStudents retain full control of their learning data. On-chain metadata ensures ownership and transparency, unlike siloed centralized platforms.\nFoundation for AI Credentialing:\nImmutable learning progress forms the backbone for future AI-driven credentialing systems. AI-generated content, assessments, and learning paths can be reliably tied to a verifiable blockchain record.\nDecentralized Agent Coordination and Trust (Smart Contract Architecture)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain:\nAgent Registry & Capabilities:\nAll core agents (e.g., Learning Style Analyst, Content Curator, Personalized Tutor) are registered via smart contracts, with:\nUnique IDs\nDefined roles and permissions\nClear scope of data access and processing\nService Agreements & Orchestration Logic:\nSmart contracts manage agent workflows. For example:\nCompletion of a module may trigger the Progress Tracker\nUpon validation, the Personalized Tutor recommends next steps\nIncentive Mechanisms:\nToken-based rewards for learning milestones, community engagement, and future decentralized agent marketplaces.\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nTrustless Agent Interaction:\nIn a multi-agent system, blockchain ensures agent behaviors and interactions are transparent, verifiable, and not reliant on a centralized authority.\nGuaranteed Execution:\nSmart contracts enforce the deterministic execution of workflows, ensuring learning paths adapt in real time based on defined rules.\nImmutable Rules:\nEducational logic, access rights, and reward systems are hard-coded and transparent, fostering trust and accountability.\nAI Enablement via the Alith Agentic Framework\nWhat is Alith:\nAlith is a modular, multi-agent framework designed to power personalized learning by simulating human-like reasoning, memory, and collaboration among AI agents. It forms the intelligence layer of our platform, with deep interoperability with blockchain systems like Hyperion.\nKey Features of Alith:\nAgent Management:\nModular deployment of specialized AI agents:\nLearning Style Analyst\nContent Curator\nPersonalized Tutor\nProgress Tracker\nCollaboration Facilitator\nPersistent Memory:\nAgents maintain long-term memory and context across sessions, enhancing personalization.\nInter-Agent Communication:\nSecure and structured communication between agents, enabling dynamic, cooperative behavior.\nToolchain Access:\nSeamless access to external APIs, knowledge bases, and assessments.\nBlockchain Integration with Alith:\nOn-Chain Agent Registry:\nAll Alith agents are registered on-chain, with roles and capabilities enforced via smart contracts.\nCoordinated Workflow Execution:\nAlith agent interactions are triggered and validated by smart contracts, enabling a trustless education logic layer.\nToken-Driven Incentives:\nAgents\u2019 performance and student outcomes can be linked to on-chain reward systems to drive engagement and adaptive learning.\nPlanned Enhancements for Alith\nTo further improve the personalization, decentralization, and performance of the Alith framework, we are planning several critical upgrades:\n1. Decentralized Agent Marketplace\nAllow community developers to contribute new agents (e.g., specialized tutors or regional content curators)\nAgents will be published and authenticated on-chain with verifiable capabilities\nToken-based reputation and staking mechanisms will prevent misuse or malicious behavior\n2. Agent Fine-Tuning via Federated Learning\nSupport for secure, privacy-preserving personalization of agent behavior based on user feedback\nFine-tuning AI agents locally or within federated clusters, without compromising sensitive student data\n3. ZK-Verifiable Inference\nIntegrate zkML (zero-knowledge machine learning) to enable cryptographic verification of off-chain AI outputs\nThis allows validators and institutions to confirm an agent\u2019s decision (e.g., a test score) without exposing the underlying model or input\n4. Composable Agent Workflows\nEnable developers and educators to compose reusable learning workflows by chaining agents together via simple declarative schemas\nBacked by on-chain validation to ensure logical and pedagogical soundness\n5. Multilingual & Accessibility Agents\nCreate plug-and-play AI agents specialized in localization, translation, and neurodiverse learning strategies\nThese agents will leverage both on-chain registries and external toolchains for broader inclusion\nSecure, Real-Time AI Inference (Leveraging Hyperion\u2019s AI-Native Infrastructure)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain (or Hyperion-enabled):\nWhile most heavy AI workloads (e.g., model training, long-form inference) run off-chain via the Alith framework, Hyperion enables:\nLightweight on-chain AI inferences for rapid adaptation and scoring\nSmart contract\u2013verified AI outputs to ensure compliance with educational standards\nReal-time coordination between on-chain logic and off-chain AI services\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nVerifiable AI Outputs:\nAI-driven assessments and tutor recommendations can be validated on-chain, ensuring educational integrity and transparency\u2014unlike opaque, centralized AI systems.\nLow Latency, High Throughput:\nHyperion\u2019s parallel execution environment supports responsive, adaptive AI interactions critical to keeping learners engaged.\nScalable AI Coordination:\nIntegrating real-time AI decision-making into a decentralized, tamper-proof environment offers performance benefits without compromising trust or cost-efficiency.\nConclusion: Blockchain as the Foundation, Not a Feature\nDeploying on Hyperion transforms the platform from an advanced AI education app into a decentralized, verifiable, trust-minimized learning ecosystem. The blockchain is not an add-on \u2014 it is the bedrock of:\nTrust in student progress\nTransparency in agent interaction\nRobust, real-time AI performance\nData Sovereignty, Incentives, and Trust in Our Education Platform\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform leverages Hyperion\u2019s blockchain to give students true control over their learning data and foster a trusted educational environment.\nData Sovereignty\nWe achieve data sovereignty by giving students self-sovereign identities (SSIs) on Hyperion. Critical learning milestones and verified skills are recorded as immutable hashes on-chain (MetisDB), tied to the student\u2019s SSI. While detailed content stays off-chain, access is cryptographically linked to and controlled by the student. This means students decide who sees what data, creating a tamper-proof and verifiable record that\u2019s genuinely theirs, free from central control.\nToken Incentives\nWe use a utility token, LearnPoints ($LP), to drive engagement:\nLearn-to-Earn (L2E): Students earn $LP for completing modules, mastering skills, and consistent engagement.\nContribution Rewards: Educators and community members earn $LP for creating content, providing feedback, or participating in forums.\nStaking & Governance: $LP can be staked for premium features or used to vote on platform decisions, aligning community interests.\nThese tokens incentivize participation, build a strong community, and add tangible value to learning achievements.\nImportance of Trust and Transparency\nIn education, trust and transparency are paramount:\nLearner Trust: Students need to trust that their achievements are real and that AI decisions (like tutoring paths) are fair and unbiased. On-chain verifiable credentials and transparent AI orchestration build this crucial trust.\nEmpowering Educators: Transparent data provides educators with reliable insights into student progress and curriculum effectiveness, reducing administrative burdens and fostering accountability.\nEquity & Accessibility: Blockchain prevents fraud and offers a universal, trusted way for students to showcase skills, democratizing opportunities regardless of background. Auditable AI decisions also help mitigate bias.\nSummary\nDeploying on Hyperion transforms our platform into a decentralized, verifiable, and trust-minimized educational ecosystem. Blockchain is the bedrock enabling trust in student progress, transparency in AI agent interactions, and robust real-time AI capabilities that define our personalized learning experience.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nPeer Study Groups: Connect with others for collaborative discussions and support.\nQ&A Forums: Ask and answer subject-related questions to deepen understanding.\nSimulated Collaboration: Practice teamwork in virtual, project-based learning scenarios.\nOptional Mentorship: Receive guidance from experienced peers and educators.\nProgress Sharing (Privacy-Controlled): Share milestones to motivate peers while maintaining control over visibility.\nCommunity Challenges: Participate in gamified group activities to promote engagement and friendly competition.\nTeam Members\n@amardeep\n@priyankg3",

Multilingual & Accessibility Agents\nCreate plug-and-play AI agents specialized in localization, translation, and neurodiverse learning strategies\nThese agents will leverage both on-chain registries and external toolchains for broader inclusion\nSecure, Real-Time AI Inference (Leveraging Hyperion\u2019s AI-Native Infrastructure)\nWhat\u2019s On-Chain (or Hyperion-enabled):\nWhile most heavy AI workloads (e.g., model training, long-form inference) run off-chain via the Alith framework, Hyperion enables:\nLightweight on-chain AI inferences for rapid adaptation and scoring\nSmart contract\u2013verified AI outputs to ensure compliance with educational standards\nReal-time coordination between on-chain logic and off-chain AI services\nWhy It Needs Blockchain:\nVerifiable AI Outputs:\nAI-driven assessments and tutor recommendations can be validated on-chain, ensuring educational integrity and transparency\u2014unlike opaque, centralized AI systems.\nLow Latency, High Throughput:\nHyperion\u2019s parallel execution environment supports responsive, adaptive AI interactions critical to keeping learners engaged.\nScalable AI Coordination:\nIntegrating real-time AI decision-making into a decentralized, tamper-proof environment offers performance benefits without compromising trust or cost-efficiency.\nConclusion: Blockchain as the Foundation, Not a Feature\nDeploying on Hyperion transforms the platform from an advanced AI education app into a decentralized, verifiable, trust-minimized learning ecosystem. The blockchain is not an add-on \u2014 it is the bedrock of:\nTrust in student progress\nTransparency in agent interaction\nRobust, real-time AI performance\nData Sovereignty, Incentives, and Trust in Our Education Platform\nOur AI-Powered Personalized Education Platform leverages Hyperion\u2019s blockchain to give students true control over their learning data and foster a trusted educational environment.\nData Sovereignty\nWe achieve data sovereignty by giving students self-sovereign identities (SSIs) on Hyperion. Critical learning milestones and verified skills are recorded as immutable hashes on-chain (MetisDB), tied to the student\u2019s SSI. While detailed content stays off-chain, access is cryptographically linked to and controlled by the student. This means students decide who sees what data, creating a tamper-proof and verifiable record that\u2019s genuinely theirs, free from central control.\nToken Incentives\nWe use a utility token, LearnPoints ($LP), to drive engagement:\nLearn-to-Earn (L2E): Students earn $LP for completing modules, mastering skills, and consistent engagement.\nContribution Rewards: Educators and community members earn $LP for creating content, providing feedback, or participating in forums.\nStaking & Governance: $LP can be staked for premium features or used to vote on platform decisions, aligning community interests.\nThese tokens incentivize participation, build a strong community, and add tangible value to learning achievements.\nImportance of Trust and Transparency\nIn education, trust and transparency are paramount:\nLearner Trust: Students need to trust that their achievements are real and that AI decisions (like tutoring paths) are fair and unbiased. On-chain verifiable credentials and transparent AI orchestration build this crucial trust.\nEmpowering Educators: Transparent data provides educators with reliable insights into student progress and curriculum effectiveness, reducing administrative burdens and fostering accountability.\nEquity & Accessibility: Blockchain prevents fraud and offers a universal, trusted way for students to showcase skills, democratizing opportunities regardless of background. Auditable AI decisions also help mitigate bias.\nSummary\nDeploying on Hyperion transforms our platform into a decentralized, verifiable, and trust-minimized educational ecosystem. Blockchain is the bedrock enabling trust in student progress, transparency in AI agent interactions, and robust real-time AI capabilities that define our personalized learning experience.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nPeer Study Groups: Connect with others for collaborative discussions and support.\nQ&A Forums: Ask and answer subject-related questions to deepen understanding.\nSimulated Collaboration: Practice teamwork in virtual, project-based learning scenarios.\nOptional Mentorship: Receive guidance from experienced peers and educators.\nProgress Sharing (Privacy-Controlled): Share milestones to motivate peers while maintaining control over visibility.\nCommunity Challenges: Participate in gamified group activities to promote engagement and friendly competition.\nTeam Members\n@amardeep\n@priyankg3"

Also, spending some time checking some of the blue checkmark accounts engaging with that post can help. That way, you can better understand whether these are real accounts posting meaningful content and genuinely engaging with the KOL, or if they\u2019re likely botted or bought accounts.\nConsistent track record \u2013 Evaluate the influencer\u2019s history in promoting projects. A KOL/influencer who is known for long-term support of a project, consistently shows up, and puts their face/voice out there is another good sign.\nCheck the consistency of their voice \u2013 A KOL who frequently changes opinions or jumps between projects might just be chasing the best payouts rather than aiming to bring value. Changing one\u2019s mind occasionally isn\u2019t always a bad sign, but if it happens often, it\u2019s definitely a red flag.\nAdditionals thing are out there, I believe also very important to use some of the tools out there also to check followers, and so on, and especially disconnect and be far from the idea that \u201cA lot of followers, likes= high quality\u201d"

A KOL constantly shifting tone or hopping between hype cycles usually signals a payout-driven motive rather than real conviction.\nAlso, checking comments for signal vs. noise has saved me more than once. Real engagement has texture generic hype rarely does.\nAppreciate the insights!"

                "comment": "CrisMetis:\nI think is important to have a post talking about KOLs/Influencer influence in web3.\nInfluencers have become super important in many fields, but in the last 4-5 years, especially in Web3, we can say that they popped-up, and right now each crypto enthusiast might be your best KOL, and the one who influences your decisions.\nHowever the way they act and create contents to drive their community and attract new users it could differentiate a lot.\nRecently many are chasing that hype, but it\u2019s key to remember that hype doesn\u2019t always equal long-term value.\nIn this evolving landscape that is Web 3 (it really changes every day, and you always have to be up to date ), Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) play a pivotal role in shaping perceptions and driving engagement. However, not all KOLs are the same. The industry faces a challenge where some influencers prioritize short-term gains over sustainable growth, leading to a proliferation of hype-driven content that lacks depth.\nTo distinguish between hype and long-term value, I believe is important to consider the following:\nEngagement Over Vanity Metrics: Focus on KOLs who foster genuine interactions within their communities, replies to DMs, post valuable guides to their communities, or even go live showing themselves out there with educational contents, rather than those who boast inflated follower counts. High engagement often correlates with a more dedicated and informed audience.\nEducational Content infact: Influencers who provide insightful analyses, tutorials, and discussions about blockchain technology, tokenomics, and more, contribute to the overall knowledge base of the community.\nTransparent Partnerships: Trustworthy KOLs disclose their affiliations and partnerships, ensuring that their endorsements are based on genuine belief in the project\u2019s value rather than financial incentives.\nConsistent Track Record: Evaluate the influencer\u2019s history of promoting projects. A consistent pattern of supporting successful and ethical projects indicates a commitment to long-term value creation.\nBy aligning with KOLs who embody these principles, whoever, an investor, a newbie or a new Web3 project, can build strong foundations, loyal and informed communities, setting the stage for more quality content and projects out there, and remember always DYOR.\nPrioritize KOLs who educate & engage authentically over hype-chasers\u2014sustainable Web3 growth hinges on transparency and real community value."

Here are two thoughtful questions to consider:\n1-How does UCTalent ensure fairness and prevent bias in AI-driven interviews, especially across diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds within the Southeast Asian talent pool?\n2- What mechanisms are in place to handle disputes or quality assurance in crypto-powered freelance services, particularly when services are delivered pseudonymously or anonymously?"

Here is my reply:\nThe feature like \u201c20-minute video interviews\u201d will start with simple version that will ask some typical questions that is customized for a pair of the position and the candidate before each call.\nThe AI just record the meeting into text, then analyze the answer and give the summary and recommendation. We build AI-driven screening as assistant tool, not a decision tool. Hiring AI Agent will auto some sourcing/screening steps and give summary and recommendation for recruiters, but do have any decision at the final step of screening stage.\nIt aims to spot disqualified talents for minimum requirements, not try to find the best and fit candidates, which still need human intelligence.\nUCTalent focuses on high tech talent, specially in Web3/blockchain and cross-border opportunities, so that English will be the default language for communication.\nThe smart contract can be designed to incorporate a dispute resolution mechanism. In case of disagreements between companies and talents/referrers regarding the referral validity, a dispute fee can be deposited into the smart contract.\nIn the first phase, UCTalent will hold the central decision on dispute resolution process. Later, when UCTalent community grows strong enough, this fee incentivizes participation in a community-based dispute resolution process on the UCTalent platform."

I have few questions in my mind to get thorough idea about it.\nYour solution emphasizes \u2018secure AI inference\u2019 with Alith and encrypted job matching. Could you elaborate on the technical mechanisms that allow your AI agents to effectively screen CVs and match talent while the underlying data remains encrypted? How do you ensure the AI can learn and improve its recommendations over time without compromising user privacy at any stage of the data lifecycle?\nWhile the Hiring AI provides summaries and doesn\u2019t make final decisions to ensure fairness, how do you plan to audit and mitigate potential biases within the AI\u2019s screening and interview question generation, particularly concerning diverse cultural nuances in SEA? Additionally, for the freelancer marketplace, what mechanisms are in place for dispute resolution between talent and companies regarding project deliverables or payments managed via Hyperion smart contracts?\nThank you"

                "comment": "Hi\n@priyankg3\nHope you doing great and thank for the great question. Here are my feedback for 2 questions:\n1. Value of Blockchain-Based Hiring for Web2 Companies (Beyond Crypto Hesitation):\nFor Web2 companies, the primary value of UCTalent\u2019s blockchain-based hiring lies in building immediate trust, verifiable transparency, and efficiency in the recruitment process, regardless of whether the final reward is paid in crypto or fiat.\nTrust and Transparency in Referrals: Blockchain creates an immutable, tamper-proof record of every referral, its terms, and the hiring outcome. This means:\nReduced Risk: Companies have full transparency on the referral flow and reward conditions, eliminating common trust issues with traditional agencies or unknown headhunters.\nVerifiable Outcomes: Every step is recorded, ensuring fairness and accountability.\nNo Upfront Commitment: Our \u201cPay If You Hire Someone\u201d cash reward model, backed by blockchain\u2019s verifiable process, allows companies to incentivize a vast network of \u201cfreelancer headhunters\u201d and external talent without any upfront payment or traditional contract complexities. This fosters trust and enables powerful crowdsourced recruitment.\nExpanded Talent Pool & Quality: By creating a trusted, incentivized system, companies can tap into a wider, often passive, network of top talent that might not be reached through traditional job boards. High-quality talent is more likely to engage when they trust the reward mechanism and the fairness of the process.\nEfficiency & Cost Savings: The automation inherent in smart contracts for reward distribution (upon successful hire) reduces administrative overhead and disputes, leading to faster, more streamlined hiring and ultimately, significant cost savings compared to traditional headhunting fees.\nIn essence, blockchain acts as a powerful trust and verification layer, creating a more reliable and efficient recruitment ecosystem that benefits all parties.\n2. Payment Flexibility: Fiat-Onboarding for Employers:\nYou\u2019re absolutely right to ask about payment flexibility! Recruiters will not be forced to pay or reward in crypto.\nFlexible Reward Options: UCTalent offers both crypto and fiat-based reward options to cater to diverse company needs:\n\u201cDeposit Crypto Reward (Money Safe Until Hire)\u201d: For crypto-native companies, they can deposit crypto directly into our smart contracts, held securely until a successful hire.\n\u201cSet Up Cash Reward (Pay If You Hire Someone)\u201d: For Web2 companies or those preferring traditional payments, they can opt for cash rewards, with payment only triggered upon successful hire. This is designed for maximum ease of adoption.\nStrategic Phased Approach:\nEarly Phase Focus: In our early phase, we are indeed focusing on Web3/blockchain companies and projects that are already familiar with and comfortable using crypto, as this allows for seamless integration with our core blockchain features from day one.\nFuture Fiat On-Ramp: As we grow and expand our user base, we will absolutely offer robust fiat-onboarding and off-ramping solutions for employers. Our goal is to make the platform accessible and user-friendly for all companies, regardless of their crypto familiarity. This ensures broad adoption and aligns with our mission to revolutionize recruitment for the entire industry.\nWe believe this flexible approach allows UCTalent to deliver immediate value to the Web3 ecosystem while strategically paving the way for broader adoption by Web2 companies."

                "comment": "Update for our proposal to focus more on Freelance headhunter as referrer, not just normal talents as they are more motivated to do referral forliving.\nRevised UCTalent Application for HyperHack\nProject Name UCTalent: AI-Powered Talent Network on Hyperion\nProblem Statement Web3 recruitment is inefficient, fragmented, and prohibitively expensive. Centralized headhunters charge massive fees (15%\u201345%), creating slow (6\u201310 weeks) hiring cycles that hinder ecosystem growth. There is a major disconnect between global companies and deep talent pools, especially in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, there is no efficient, on-chain marketplace for Web3 freelancers to offer services and get paid, nor a way for freelance headhunters to effectively monetize their networks.\nSolution Overview UCTalent is an AI-powered talent network built on Hyperion to decentralize and accelerate recruitment. We leverage the Alith AI Agent framework and Hyperion\u2019s high-throughput infrastructure to create a transparent, low-cost, and efficient ecosystem for hiring, freelancing, and decentralized headhunting.\nDecentralized Headhunting on Hyperion: Companies post on-chain referral rewards on Hyperion smart contracts. Any freelance headhunter can refer talent and earn the reward upon a successful hire, creating a transparent, permissionless recruitment model.\nOn-Chain Freelancer Marketplace: A dedicated marketplace where Web3 professionals can offer services (e.g., smart contract audits, UI design) and get paid instantly in crypto via Hyperion\u2019s fast, low-cost transactions.\nAI Agents Powered by Alith: Our dual Alith AI Agents\u2014Career and Hiring\u2014use secure, on-chain AI to automate job matching, CV screening, and interviews, dramatically increasing the speed and efficiency of the entire hiring process.\nProject Description UCTalent is building the future of Web3 talent acquisition on Hyperion with these core features:\nDecentralized Headhunting: The core of our platform. Companies lock a referral reward into a Hyperion smart contract. This incentivizes a global network of freelance headhunters to source and refer top candidates. The smart contract, running on Hyperion\u2019s scalable infrastructure, guarantees instant and transparent payment to the successful headhunter upon hire.\nFreelancer Marketplace: To drive immediate economic activity, UCTalent features a dedicated marketplace. Web3 talent can list their services and find short-term projects. All transactions are settled on-chain via Hyperion, ensuring fast, reliable, and low-cost crypto payments for completed work.\nHiring/Talent AI Agent Framework: Our competitive edge lies in our dual AI agents, built using the Alith AI Agent framework for secure and scalable AI operations on-chain.\nHiring AI Agent: Helps companies generate optimized job posts and provides freelance headhunters with powerful tools to screen candidates. It leverages Alith AI to conduct automated initial interviews, summarizing qualifications for rapid review.\nCareer AI Agent: Empowers talent and freelancers to build dynamic profiles and receive intelligent job or project recommendations based on their skills and on-chain activity.\nBuilt for Hyperion: The entire platform leverages Hyperion\u2019s MetisVM for parallel execution, ensuring our application is fast, responsive, and can scale to handle a high volume of transactions for referrals, payments, and AI-driven actions. KYC integration ensures a high-quality, spam-free network.\nCommunity Engagement Features UCTalent gamifies participation, leveraging Hyperion to build a vibrant community of talent, freelancers, and headhunters.\nTasks:\nCreate a talent, freelancer, or headhunter profile (with KYC): 1,000 points.\nList a service on the Freelancer Marketplace: 500 points.\nRefer a verified candidate who gets an interview: 2,000 points.\nTest the Alith AI job matching and interview features: 300 points/task.\nSubmit UX/bug feedback on the Hyperion testnet deployment: 200 points/submission.\nPoints System: Pioneer Program points convert to UCTalent Tokens (1:1, capped 100,000/year), used for premium features like promoting a freelance service or boosting a candidate\u2019s profile.\nGamification: Leaderboards will track the most successful freelance headhunters and top-earning freelancers, creating a competitive and rewarding environment powered by on-chain activity on Hyperion.\nGetting Involved Join UCTalent\u2019s HyperHack journey:\nFreelancers & Headhunters: Create your profile, list a service on our marketplace, and test the referral system on Hyperion\u2019s testnet.\nDevelopers: Help us build the future of recruitment. Contribute to our Solidity contracts and Alith AI integrations via our Discord and the Metis Forum.\nFeedback: Stress-test our entire platform, from the marketplace to the AI tools, from July 15\u2013August 7 and earn rewards for your feedback.\nCompanies: Test our AI-powered hiring tools to see how you can accelerate hiring and reduce costs on the Hyperion network."

It would be a great way to gather like-minded builders, share content, and collaborate on the ecosystem.\nA seperate section for documentation in the forum: When I joined Hyperhack, I struggled to find organized documentation for Metis, LazAI, and Alith. A dedicated section or hub for all docs would be a big help for newcomers like me."

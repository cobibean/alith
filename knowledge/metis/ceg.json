We weren\u2019t just watching slides; we were actually minting our own private DATs (Data Anchoring Tokens) with a little Python magic. Mint.py\nBasically, we were getting under the hood of LazAI\u2019s data registry \u2014 learning how data anchoring works, why it matters for privacy, and how you can actually trace stuff without exposing it. Pretty slick.\nThe mint.py script handles all the heavy lifting: encrypts your file so no one\u2019s peeking, shoots it up to IPFS via Pinata, registers it on the blockchain as a DAT, and even chases down a proof and an on-chain reward for you. Encryption, decentralized storage, and blockchain\nPrepping the Playground\nFirst things first, I had to set up a virtual environment and grab a few Python libraries:\npython -m venv venv\nvenv\\Scripts\\activate\npip install alith python-dotenv rsa eth-account openai\nThen came the secret sauce \u2014 environment variables.

Not gonna lie, it\u2019s pretty cool. I could actually see my data as a real, verifiable piece of the LazAI puzzle.\nWanna See My Project?\nYep, the whole thing\u2019s up on My GitHub: DAT Mint",

Rust brings unmatched performance, safety, and efficiency to AI workloads, and with Alith\u2019s Rust SDK, developers can now build high-performance AI agents that interact seamlessly with models like GPT-4, DeepSeek, Claude, HuggingFace.\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll explore how to integrate these models in Rust \u2014 from setting API keys to building an intelligent agent that performs with precision.\nSetup\nInstall Alith via Cargo:\ncargo add alith\nSet the required API keys before running the code:\nUnix\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=<your API key>\nWindows\n**$env:**OPENAI_API_KEY = \u201c\u201d\nOpenAI Models\nuse alith::{Agent, Chat, LLM};\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {\nlet model = LLM::from_model_name(\"gpt-4\")?;\nlet agent = Agent::new(\"simple agent\", model)         \n          .preamble(\"You are a comedian here to entertain the user using humour and jokes.\");  let response = agent.prompt(\"Entertain me!\").await?;\nprintln!(\"{}\", response);\nOk(()) }\nWith just a few lines, you can create a Rust-based agent that interacts with OpenAI models through Alith.\nOpenAI-Compatible Models (DeepSeek Example)\nuse alith::{Agent, Chat, LLM};\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() \u2192 Result<(), anyhow::Error> {\nlet model = LLM::openai_compatible_model(\n       \u201c<YOUR_API_KEY\u201d,\n       \u201c``api.deepseek.com``\u201d,\n       \u201cdeepseek-chat\u201d,  )?;\nlet agent = Agent::new(\u201csimple agent\u201d, model)\n        .preamble(\u201cYou are a comedian here to entertain the user using humour and jokes.\u201d);\nlet response = agent.prompt(\u201cEntertain me!\u201d).await?;\nprintln!(\u201c{}\u201d, response);\nOk(()) }\nSwitching between models like GPT-4 and DeepSeek becomes effortless with Alith\u2019s modular architecture.\nAnthropic Models (Claude)\nuse alith::{Agent, Chat, LLM};\n #[tokio::main]\n async fn main() \u2192 Result<(), anyhow::Error> {\n let model = LLM::from_model_name( \u201cclaude-3-5-sonnet\u201d)?;\n let agent = Agent::new(\u201csimple agent\u201d, model)\n           .preamble(\u201cYou are a comedian here to entertain the user using humour and jokes.\u201d);\n let response = agent.prompt(\u201cEntertain me!\u201d).await?;\n println!(\u201c{}\u201d, response);\n Ok(()) }\nYou can connect directly to Anthropic\u2019s Claude models while maintaining Alith\u2019s unified agent interface.\nHuggingFace Models\nuse alith::HuggingFaceLoader; fn main() \u2192 Result<(), anyhow::Error> {\nlet_path =HuggingFaceLoader::new().load_file(\n\u201cmodel.safetensors\u201d,\n\u201cgpt2\u201d)?;\nOk(())}\nUse the HF_ENDPOINT environment variable to customize your HuggingFace endpoint when needed.\nConclusion\nAlith\u2019s Rust SDK bridges the gap between AI performance and developer control, enabling full integration with leading LLM providers. From GPT-4 to DeepSeek, from HuggingFace to Claude \u2014 Alith ensures that your agents are modular, efficient, and verifiable, all within a single Rust-powered framework.\nIf Python and JS brought flexibility, Rust brings speed, safety, and precision \u2014 making Alith the ultimate toolkit for decentralized AI innovation.",

Rust brings unmatched performance, safety, and efficiency to AI workloads, and with Alith\u2019s Rust SDK, developers can now build high-performance AI agents that interact seamlessly with models like GPT-4, DeepSeek, Claude, HuggingFace.\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll explore how to integrate these models in Rust \u2014 from setting API keys to building an intelligent agent that performs with precision.\nSetup\nInstall Alith via Cargo:\ncargo add alith\nSet the required API keys before running the code:\nUnix\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=<your API key>\nWindows\n**$env:**OPENAI_API_KEY = \u201c\u201d\nOpenAI Models\nuse alith::{Agent, Chat, LLM};\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {\nlet model = LLM::from_model_name(\"gpt-4\")?;\nlet agent = Agent::new(\"simple agent\", model)         \n          .preamble(\"You are a comedian here to entertain the user using humour and jokes.\");  let response = agent.prompt(\"Entertain me!\").await?;\nprintln!(\"{}\", response);\nOk(()) }\nWith just a few lines, you can create a Rust-based agent that interacts with OpenAI models through Alith.\nOpenAI-Compatible Models (DeepSeek Example)\nuse alith::{Agent, Chat, LLM};\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() \u2192 Result<(), anyhow::Error> {\nlet model = LLM::openai_compatible_model(\n       \u201c<YOUR_API_KEY\u201d,\n       \u201c``api.deepseek.com``\u201d,\n       \u201cdeepseek-chat\u201d,  )?;\nlet agent = Agent::new(\u201csimple agent\u201d, model)\n        .preamble(\u201cYou are a comedian here to entertain the user using humour and jokes.\u201d);\nlet response = agent.prompt(\u201cEntertain me!\u201d).await?;\nprintln!(\u201c{}\u201d, response);\nOk(()) }\nSwitching between models like GPT-4 and DeepSeek becomes effortless with Alith\u2019s modular architecture.\nAnthropic Models (Claude)\nuse alith::{Agent, Chat, LLM};\n #[tokio::main]\n async fn main() \u2192 Result<(), anyhow::Error> {\n let model = LLM::from_model_name( \u201cclaude-3-5-sonnet\u201d)?;\n let agent = Agent::new(\u201csimple agent\u201d, model)\n           .preamble(\u201cYou are a comedian here to entertain the user using humour and jokes.\u201d);\n let response = agent.prompt(\u201cEntertain me!\u201d).await?;\n println!(\u201c{}\u201d, response);\n Ok(()) }\nYou can connect directly to Anthropic\u2019s Claude models while maintaining Alith\u2019s unified agent interface.\nHuggingFace Models\nuse alith::HuggingFaceLoader; fn main() \u2192 Result<(), anyhow::Error> {\nlet_path =HuggingFaceLoader::new().load_file(\n\u201cmodel.safetensors\u201d,\n\u201cgpt2\u201d)?;\nOk(())}\nUse the HF_ENDPOINT environment variable to customize your HuggingFace endpoint when needed.\nConclusion\nAlith\u2019s Rust SDK bridges the gap between AI performance and developer control, enabling full integration with leading LLM providers. From GPT-4 to DeepSeek, from HuggingFace to Claude \u2014 Alith ensures that your agents are modular, efficient, and verifiable, all within a single Rust-powered framework.\nIf Python and JS brought flexibility, Rust brings speed, safety, and precision \u2014 making Alith the ultimate toolkit for decentralized AI innovation."

        "content": "LazAI Data Query: Taking Control of Your AI Data\nby Danny Steffe | LazAI Dev Ambassador\nIn today\u2019s digital age, artificial intelligence interacts with vast amounts of personal and organizational data. While AI can provide amazing insights, the question remains: who really controls the data? Enter LazAI Data Query\u2014a tool designed to put data ownership back in the hands of the user.\nWhat Is LazAI Data Query?\nAt its core, LazAI Data Query is like a personal digital vault for your AI data. It allows you to query your own information\u2014to ask questions, generate insights, or run analyses\u2014without ever compromising your privacy. Unlike traditional systems where data is stored on centralized servers and controlled by third parties, LazAI ensures that you remain the sole owner of your data.\nHow It Works: Privacy and Security\nOne of the biggest concerns in AI today is privacy. Most AI applications rely on massive datasets, which often include sensitive personal information. LazAI Data Query addresses this by:\nSecure Access: Only the data owner can query their information. No one else can access it without permission.\nCryptographic Protection: Every query is verified using cryptography, ensuring that the data remains untampered.\nDecentralized Management: Data isn\u2019t stored in one central location. It leverages blockchain-based principles to maintain integrity, transparency, and security.\nThis approach ensures that your interactions with your data are safe, private, and trustworthy.\nVerifiable Access: Proof You Own Your Data\nOwnership in AI is more than just having a username and password. LazAI Data Query ensures that every interaction is verifiable. This means:\nYou can prove that your data hasn\u2019t been altered.\nYou can settle results on-chain, creating a permanent record of queries and outcomes.\nYou maintain full control over who can see or use your data.\nThis system is especially important for enterprises, developers, and researchers who rely on accurate, trustworthy data for AI applications.\nReal-World Benefits\nUsing LazAI Data Query brings multiple advantages:\nFull Data Ownership: You decide who gets access to your information.\nEnhanced Privacy: Sensitive information stays protected at all times.\nTransparent and Verifiable: Every query leaves a cryptographic record, ensuring accountability.\nIntegration-Ready: Works seamlessly with AI models, analytics tools, and Web3 infrastructures.\nReduced Risk: No third-party monopolization of your data.\nBy providing these benefits, LazAI empowers users to interact with AI safely, securely, and confidently.\nWhy It Matters\nIn a world where data drives AI, ownership and trust are key. LazAI Data Query gives users the ability to leverage the power of AI while keeping full control over their digital footprint. It\u2019s more than just a tool\u2014it\u2019s a data guardian, ensuring that your information is safe, verifiable, and truly yours.\nConclusion\nLazAI Data Query is a game-changer in the AI space. It bridges the gap between powerful AI capabilities and data privacy, security, and ownership. Whether you\u2019re an individual, developer, or enterprise, it allows you to ask questions, gain insights, and interact with your data safely.\n@LazAI",

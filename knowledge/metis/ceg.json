I couldn\u2019t take my kids to the movies or the pool. I couldn\u2019t be unreachable, even for an hour. I couldn\u2019t have a glass of wine at dinner. And with a 10-month-old baby at home, those late-night calls affected more than just me, they disrupted my whole family.\nAll of that, for $1 an hour. Canadian.\nA full holiday weekend from Friday to Monday, three and a half days on standby, for all the inconvenience and disruption, compensated about $90.\nEveryone knew it was unfair.\nEveryone also said, \u201cIt\u2019s in the bylaws. You can\u2019t change it.\u201d\nBut I didn\u2019t accept that.\nI found every person who was regularly on call. I met them, listened, and gathered support. I researched what others in other cities and police agencies were paid, documented the case, and together we submitted a request for negotiation to our union. Met with the union, finalized the case.\nIt worked!\nSince then, at the Edmonton Police Service and the City of Edmonton, people on standby duty are paid a fair rate. A long weekend now is compensated at about $500, not $90. That\u2019s dignity.\nThis wasn\u2019t handed down from above. It wasn\u2019t a gift.\nIt was ordinary people seeing a problem, connecting, and doing something about it.\nThe lesson was simple:\nChange doesn\u2019t start from permission. It starts when people decide they\u2019re ready to act.\nToday, looking around at how technology and AI are evolving, I see bigger problems\u2014and the same patterns of silence.\nIn my previous letter, I talked about some of the real problems I believe we need to solve:\nGovernments make decisions based on emotion, bias, or incomplete knowledge, leading to wars and economic failures.\nInefficiencies in national and corporate governance, where short-term thinking dominates long-term good.\nUnstable economic policies, crashing lives, and livelihoods because of poor planning and reactive decision-making.\nSmall businesses are struggling because they lack the tools and insights to navigate complex markets and hiring strategies.\nUniversities fall behind on education while charging an arm and a leg as tuition.\nPrices are growing like crazy, while salaries are lagging\nAI is centralized and controlled by a few who will be controlling all of us pretty soon.\nAnd from my experience in Web3, I\u2019ve seen something else too: demanding big returns without bringing in real value.\nThe community I want to help build is different. It\u2019s for those who think and do.\nThose who know that real change takes more than posting complaints. Instead, it takes showing up, listening, thinking, and building. Together!\nWe\u2019re opening a simple space, a forum. Not to sell anything. Not to manage anyone.\nBut to bring together people who care enough to try.\nPeople who want to think about how AI can serve humans, not control them.\nPeople who want to solve the problems they are sick and tired of.\nPeople who are tired of seeing decisions made from the top down, without care for the people affected.\nPeople who are ready to work, even if the path forward isn\u2019t clear yet.\nIf this speaks to you, you are welcome.\nBring your experiences.\nBring your ideas.\nBring your willingness to start small, and your belief that small actions, shared by many, can change big things.\nWe\u2019ll figure the rest out together.\nElena.",

I see lots of opportunities, but lots of problems too.\nJust recently I talked to a friend who is a founder of a large company My friend is a huge fan of AI and is using ChatGPT and other centralized AIs a lot. Even replaced many of the company positions with AI. What my friend wasn\u2019t not aware is that once you enter any data, any documents into AI prompt, this data stay in there forever. Many people don\u2019t realize that and feeding AIs their personal medical records, passports, bank statements etc. The data itself might be removed by lets say OpenAI from, even though there is no way to check that. But what is worrying, that AI model can not unlearn it once it learned something. So, the is no way to delete it from this AI. It means not only you can be stuck paying to OpenAI subscription for life, but also they own your very very personal data forever.\nSo, it is very very important to make sure that people own and control the data and have control over how AIs learned this data are used.\nSo, bit by bit we will build this future world where each of us has a full control"

Indeed, we can give AI information, but after that we completely lose control.\nThis reminds me of the situation when in 2022 the App Store adopted a mandatory rule for mobile apps to have an account deletion function. It\u2019s funny, but before 2022 we created dozens of accounts in different apps, but we couldn\u2019t delete them. The services simply didn\u2019t make logic for this!\nI think that the problem you voiced will sooner or later become a problem and we will see measures that will allow us to control personal information in AI.\nBut what to do with what the model already knows? I have no answer to this\ud83e\udd14"

Manual management is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires constant vigilance as interest rates fluctuate across platforms. This complexity creates a significant barrier to maximizing returns, especially for non-technical users.\nSolution Overview\nYieldMaximizer is an intelligent AI agent system that automates yield optimization across multiple DeFi lending platforms through a familiar Telegram interface. The system continuously monitors market conditions, identifies optimal strategies including recursive lending/borrowing loops and cross-platform arbitrage, and executes them based on user-defined risk parameters. This approach democratizes sophisticated yield farming techniques previously available only to experienced DeFi power users. The implementation is designed to be protocol-agnostic and can adapt to work with available DeFi protocols like Uniswap v3 and Compound v2 forks, potentially pivoting to LP providing strategies when needed.\nProject Description\nYieldMaximizer revolutionizes DeFi yield optimization by bringing institutional-grade strategies to retail users through Telegram\u2019s accessible interface. The system employs multiple specialized AI agents working in concert to analyze market conditions, identify opportunities, and execute complex multi-step transactions.\nCore features include the \u201cLoop Amplification\u201d engine that creates recursive lending-borrowing loops on single platforms, \u201cBridge Maximization\u201d for cross-protocol arbitrage, and dynamic risk-adjusted positioning that continuously recalibrates based on changing conditions. The system leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) technology (with our own MCP server for certain components) and the Alith framework to maintain coherent understanding across interactions, remembering user preferences, portfolio composition, and past decisions without requiring users to repeat information.\nWhile initially designed for lending/borrowing platforms, the system architecture is flexible enough to optimize liquidity positions across Uniswap v3 pools with different fee tiers and concentration ranges if traditional lending protocols aren\u2019t available. The core AI agent infrastructure remains valuable for identifying optimal strategies regardless of the specific DeFi protocols in the ecosystem.\nUsers connect their wallets through secure WalletConnect integration, set their risk preferences, and receive personalized strategy recommendations with projected APY directly in chat. The system then monitors positions 24/7, providing alerts and implementing automatic rebalancing when market conditions change. All of this happens through a natural, conversational interface that explains complex strategies in accessible terms tailored to each user\u2019s demonstrated technical understanding.\nWhat makes this project particularly exciting is how it removes significant barriers to DeFi adoption while promoting capital efficiency across the ecosystem, all through a messaging app that billions of people already have installed.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nStrategy Discovery (50 points): Users connect their wallet and complete the risk preference questionnaire to receive their first personalized strategy recommendation.\nFirst Position Deployment (100 points): Users approve and execute their first yield strategy, demonstrating the seamless transaction flow.\nCross-Platform Arbitrage (75 points): Users activate a Bridge Maximization strategy that spans multiple lending platforms or liquidity pools.\nStrategy Optimization (50 points): Users adjust their risk parameters and observe how the system recalibrates their positions.\nReferral Program (25 points per referral): Users earn points by inviting others to the platform, with bonus points when referred users deploy their first strategy.\nYield Milestone Achievements (variable points): Users unlock badges and points when their strategies reach specific yield thresholds.\nThis gamification approach creates clear milestones for users to achieve, encouraging deeper platform engagement while simultaneously educating them about DeFi concepts. The points system provides instant gratification for completing actions that benefit both the user and the platform ecosystem.\nGetting Involved\nInterested community members can join our project by:\nJoining our Telegram channel at Telegram: View @gmetisio\nFollowing our development updates on Twitter/X @gMetisL2\nContributing to our open-source components on GitHub Gmetisl2 (gMetis) \u00b7 GitHub\nParticipating in our upcoming beta testing program by signing up at YieldMaximizer.gmetis.io (website launching later)\nReaching out directly to our team via dev@gmetis.io for partnership opportunities or technical collaboration\nJoining our open dev sessions (dates to be announced) where we\u2019ll troubleshoot implementation challenges together",

The only way is to build such interfaces and end products for them so, they can interact via text prompts similar that they use for ChatGPT or hopefully better than that. So this idea is based on their requests."

Click on it and you\u2019ll be taken to the Docs page, where you can find all the details about the Hyperion network. Let me know if you need any more help!"

        "content": "Metis Andromeda Network Update: DA Migration & Fraud Proofs\nDear Metis Community,\nWe would like to provide an update on two key upgrades to the Metis Andromeda network: Fraud Proofs and Data Availability (DA) migration to Ethereum 4844 blobs. These upgrades are now live on the Metis Sepolia testnet and are undergoing testing. Pending successful evaluation, we plan to deploy them to Andromeda Mainnet after the Ethereum Pectra upgrade on March 27th.\nThese upgrades enhance network security, decentralization, and trustlessness by providing a permissionless mechanism to challenge invalid transactions and ensuring that all transaction data is available on Ethereum for independent verification.\nKey Changes\n1. Data Availability (DA) Migration to Ethereum L1 4844 Blobs\nBackground\nData availability is a fundamental requirement for rollups, ensuring that all transaction data is accessible for verification by network participants. When transactions are processed on Metis, their data must be stored in a way that allows anyone to reconstruct the network state independently.\nPreviously, Metis used MEMO Labs as its DA provider, offering an off-chain storage solution that reduced costs while maintaining scalability. However, with the introduction of Ethereum EIP-4844 blobs, we now have the opportunity to migrate our DA layer to Ethereum L1 and inherit its security guarantees.\nWhy Migrate to Ethereum 4844 Blobs?\nThe primary reason for this migration is to inherit Ethereum\u2019s security model, ensuring that Metis transactions remain verifiable and immutable within Ethereum\u2019s consensus framework. While the cost of using Ethereum blobs is slightly higher than using MEMO Labs, the difference is negligible and will not impact transaction fees on Metis.\nBy migrating to Ethereum\u2019s native DA storage, Metis strengthens the integrity and auditability of its transactions without introducing significant overhead costs. This move also formally designates Metis as a Stage 0 Rollup, ensuring that all transaction data is published on Ethereum for maximum transparency and reliability.\n2. Fraud Proofs & Enhanced Security Mechanisms\nIntroduction to Fraud Proofs\nFraud proofs introduce a verification mechanism that enables anyone to challenge invalid state transitions on the network. This ensures that only valid transactions are finalized, removing the need to trust any single entity.\nHow Fraud Proofs Work\nFraud proofs allow network participants to challenge invalid state roots submitted by sequencers. The process works as follows:\nState Submission: Sequencers submit state updates to Ethereum, assuming they are correct unless proven otherwise.\nChallenge Window: A dispute period allows anyone to challenge an invalid state.\nDispute Resolution: If a challenge is raised, the network verifies whether the state transition was correct.

                "comment": "Metis Andromeda Network Update: DA Migration & Fraud Proofs\nDear Metis Community,\nWe would like to provide an update on two key upgrades to the Metis Andromeda network: Fraud Proofs and Data Availability (DA) migration to Ethereum 4844 blobs. These upgrades are now live on the Metis Sepolia testnet and are undergoing testing. Pending successful evaluation, we plan to deploy them to Andromeda Mainnet after the Ethereum Pectra upgrade on March 27th.\nThese upgrades enhance network security, decentralization, and trustlessness by providing a permissionless mechanism to challenge invalid transactions and ensuring that all transaction data is available on Ethereum for independent verification.\nKey Changes\n1. Data Availability (DA) Migration to Ethereum L1 4844 Blobs\nBackground\nData availability is a fundamental requirement for rollups, ensuring that all transaction data is accessible for verification by network participants. When transactions are processed on Metis, their data must be stored in a way that allows anyone to reconstruct the network state independently.\nPreviously, Metis used MEMO Labs as its DA provider, offering an off-chain storage solution that reduced costs while maintaining scalability. However, with the introduction of Ethereum EIP-4844 blobs, we now have the opportunity to migrate our DA layer to Ethereum L1 and inherit its security guarantees.\nWhy Migrate to Ethereum 4844 Blobs?\nThe primary reason for this migration is to inherit Ethereum\u2019s security model, ensuring that Metis transactions remain verifiable and immutable within Ethereum\u2019s consensus framework. While the cost of using Ethereum blobs is slightly higher than using MEMO Labs, the difference is negligible and will not impact transaction fees on Metis.\nBy migrating to Ethereum\u2019s native DA storage, Metis strengthens the integrity and auditability of its transactions without introducing significant overhead costs. This move also formally designates Metis as a Stage 0 Rollup, ensuring that all transaction data is published on Ethereum for maximum transparency and reliability.\n2. Fraud Proofs & Enhanced Security Mechanisms\nIntroduction to Fraud Proofs\nFraud proofs introduce a verification mechanism that enables anyone to challenge invalid state transitions on the network. This ensures that only valid transactions are finalized, removing the need to trust any single entity.\nHow Fraud Proofs Work\nFraud proofs allow network participants to challenge invalid state roots submitted by sequencers. The process works as follows:\nState Submission: Sequencers submit state updates to Ethereum, assuming they are correct unless proven otherwise.\nChallenge Window: A dispute period allows anyone to challenge an invalid state.\nDispute Resolution: If a challenge is raised, the network verifies whether the state transition was correct. If the challenge is successful, the invalid state submission is rejected, and the responsible sequencer is penalized.\nThis system ensures that fraudulent transactions cannot be finalized, maintaining the integrity of the rollup without requiring centralized oversight.\nHow This Enhances Trustlessness\nPermissionless Challenges: Any participant can dispute an invalid state, ensuring that only valid transactions are finalized.\nIndependent Withdrawal Verification: Users can withdraw funds without needing to trust the operator, as transactions are independently verifiable on Ethereum.\nThis upgrade brings Metis closer to a Stage 1 Rollup, further reducing trust assumptions and enhancing the network\u2019s decentralization.\n3. Sequencer Slashing & Security Enhancements\nSlashing & Removal: If a sequencer submits an invalid state (e.g., incorrect transaction data or an invalid state root), they will be slashed and removed from the sequencer pool. This discourages malicious behavior and reinforces the integrity of the system.\nSelf-Sequencing Plans: Future upgrades will introduce self-sequencing, allowing users to propose their own transactions. This ensures that users retain control over their transactions, even in cases of sequencer failure or network congestion.\nNext Steps & Timeline\nMainnet Deployment: These upgrades will be rolled out to Andromeda Mainnet after Ethereum\u2019s Pectra upgrade on March 27th.\nOngoing Security & Decentralization Improvements: Additional enhancements will continue to improve Metis\u2019 security, scalability, and trustless execution environment.\nThese upgrades mark an important step in improving Metis\u2019 security and decentralization, providing users with a more robust, verifiable, and independent Layer 2 experience."

How long?\nHere. I would like to go into more detail on the issue and the next steps that Metis wants to take to get closer to Stage 1.\nThanks for the work and for the collaboration"

        "content": "Prelude\nAs the Metis community and ecosystem continue to grow, we\u2019re seeing a whole new wave of opportunities to make a real impact in the world.\nProjects like Hyperion have the potential to revolutionize AI in the same way smart contracts transformed computing. LazAI is working to ensure that AI isn\u2019t just aligned with human values but also open and accessible to everyone. We\u2019re stepping into an exciting new chapter for Metis.\nWith so much potential ahead of us, it\u2019s important to pause and reflect. We shouldn\u2019t build just for the sake of building. We need to think about where this technology is taking us - and how we can shape it to create an ecosystem that delivers real value, not just for businesses but for everyday people too.\nToday, I want to talk to you, our amazing community, about one of Metis\u2019s core values: governance. I touched on this briefly at the ETHDenver kickoff, but now it\u2019s time to dive deeper. Not just into governance on Metis, but into something even more exciting: the vision of how people and AI can come together.\nDecentralized governance has already proven to be a powerful force in our industry. And as AI becomes a central part of Metis, we believe it\u2019s the ideal partner to help guide and strengthen this governance model and perhaps humanity.\nBackground\nA quick recap of recent developments and announcements at Metis:\nMetis ReGenesis is a refocusing of Metis on not only driving real value and use cases but also on the next step for the blockchain space \u2013 AI.\nAs part of ReGenesis, we are launching a new chain to build a home for AI (Hyperion) that will coexist with Andromeda while incubating LazAI. This will solve the data-alignment problem and democratize AI assets.\nGovernance on Metis will evolve into more than a simple voting mechanism \u2013 it\u2019ll be a gathering of discussions, ideas, and most importantly, the action potential and thus value.\nIn exploring the applications of Alith, LazAI\u2019s homegrown AI agent framework, we\u2019ve had a chance to envision what is not only the potential but the ideal in which we may all work towards.\nLet\u2019s dig in, starting with the historical context.\nThe Efficient and Balanced Alignment of AI and Humans\nPhilosophical Roots\nThroughout history, philosophers have sought to build societies where everyone feels free and happy. Many thinkers, from Socrates to modern philosophers, have debated governance models that balance power, virtue, and reason. Despite various societal advancements, no system has fully achieved this goal.\nOne common thread among the great philosophers is that any society should be led or governed by highly educated, reasonable, and virtuous individuals who can predict the consequences of decisions and guide society toward prosperity, freedom, and happiness.\nPlato: Proposed the \u201cPhilosopher-King\u201d model, arguing that the wisest and virtuous individuals should rule rather than those born into power or wealth. Only those with deep philosophical knowledge and rational thinking can govern justly, as they seek truth over personal gain.\nAristotle: Advocated for the balance of wisdom, virtue, and participation. Insight: The best rulers are those trained in virtue, ethics, and reason, ensuring that decisions are made for the common good.\nConfucius. Confucian philosophy emphasizes that rulers must be wise, virtuous, and morally upright (the concept of Ren - benevolence).\nImmanuel Kant: Kant\u2019s categorical imperative suggests that moral laws should be universal and based on reason rather than emotion or self-interest.\nThe list doesn\u2019t end there, as the likes of John Stuart Mill, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Friedrich Hayek, Yuval Noah Harari, and more have all come to similar conclusions. As shown, numerous great thinkers have all pointed towards the same idea: rulers must be wise, virtuous, and based on reason.\nHistorical Precedents\nHistorically, some of the most successful governance models followed these philosophers\u2019 insights:\nSingapore: Lee Kuan Yew (Plato & Aristotle). He prioritized governance by highly educated and virtuous leaders. Singapore\u2019s government carefully selected and trained its leaders, ensuring that the most capable individuals made key policy decisions. Singapore transformed from a poor, unstable city-state in the 1960s to one of the world\u2019s most advanced economies.\nUnited States: The Founding Fathers (Locke & Montesquieu). The U.S. Constitution was designed around Locke\u2019s life, liberty, and property principles. A system of checks and balances (inspired by Montesquieu) was implemented to prevent tyranny and ensure governance by reason and law. Early American leaders like John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton focused on education, rational governance, and long-term planning. The U.S. became the world\u2019s most powerful democracy, leading in innovation, economic growth, and individual freedoms.\nSwitzerland: Decentralized Governance (Montesquieu & Hayek). Swiss leaders prioritize rational, evidence-based governance, avoiding political extremes. Switzerland remains one of the wealthiest and most stable countries in the world.\nMore examples: Germany in Post-WWII Reconstruction (Immanuel Kant & Hayek), South Korea\u2019s Scientific and Rational Leadership (Confucius & Locke), China\u2019s Technocratic Governance (Confucius & Legalism)\nAI as the Modern Philosopher-King\nIn the present era, AI is the most educated \u201cindividual\u201d in the world. It has vast knowledge, the ability to predict outcomes, and can offer valuable insights. However, it must not replace human governance but act as an advisor - a concept we call the Efficient and Balanced Alignment of AI and Humans.\nThis tandem ensures AI serves as a highly educated advisor while humans retain decision-making power, applying ethical and emotional intelligence to any decision.\nMetis\u2019 Unique Position\nMetis is uniquely positioned to implement the Efficient and Balanced Alignment of AI and Humans due to its commitment to decentralization across multiple layers:\nDecentralized Sequencers (MetisL2 & GOAT Network) - Unlike traditional Layer 2 solutions, MetisL2 operates on a fully decentralized sequencer model, ensuring no single entity can control the network. This decentralized architecture naturally aligns with the ideology of distributed wisdom and fairness, preventing centralization risks in AI-assisted governance.\nCross-Chain Reach - Metis is not confined to a single ecosystem. The upcoming Metis SDK allows seamless interoperability between other chains, and by bridging Ethereum (MetisL2), Bitcoin (GOAT), and other networks, Metis ensures interoperability and decentralization at a global scale that isn\u2019t confined to a single ecosystem.\nNew Paradigm in AI Assetization and Democratization - With everything from verified computing, iDAOs (individual-centric DAOs) that manage these assets, DATs (Data Anchoring Tokens) to allow accessible assetization while anchoring the full lifecycle of AI assets from models to agents, LazAI provides a holistic solution to the AI alignment problem. The core problem that LazAI is solving - the AI alignment problem - is the same core of the AI we\u2019ll need to ensure that true AI governance aligns with human needs and vision.\nThe Meaning of Metis. In Greek, Metis (\u039c\u1fc6\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2) means wisdom, skill, or cunning intelligence. Metis\u2019s name was inspired by Greek mythology, where Metis was a Titaness of Wisdom, symbolizing the vision of an AI that enhances human wisdom rather than replacing it. This directly aligns with the ideology of a Balanced Tandem of AI and Humans, where AI serves as a knowledgeable advisor without exerting unchecked power.\nWith this robust foundation in decentralization, cross-chain interoperability, and a commitment to ethical AI governance, Metis is not just another Web3 platform - it is the ideal proving ground for a decentralized AI-human collaboration model that can reshape governance, businesses, and societies for the better.\nSolving Real Problems Through AI-Human Collaboration\nThe Metis ideal of the Efficient and Balanced Alignment of AI and Humans has the potential to solve a wide range of problems, spanning from global issues to smaller, yet impactful challenges within businesses and governance.\nGlobal Problems Human-Aligned AI Can Solve\nGlobal Political Inefficiencies & Misalignment with the People\nProblem: Governments often make uninformed, biased, or emotionally charged decisions that lead to war and economic disasters.\nSolution: AI can analyze historical data, predict geopolitical risks, and propose the best diplomatic strategies based on proven governance models. A decentralized, AI-assisted advisory system for world governance (similar to a non-corrupt UN) could reduce global conflicts by fostering educated, unbiased decision-making.\nLarge-Scale Problems Human-Aligned AI Can Solve\nInefficiencies in National and Corporate Governance\nProblem: Many decisions are made based on limited knowledge, leading to policy failures and mismanagement.\nSolution: AI can study historical cases from the original philosophy books and historical archives of successful and failed governance, offering data-driven insights that help decision-makers predict long-term outcomes.\nUnstable Economic Policies\nProblem: Economic crashes and crises often result from poor financial planning and short-term decision-making.\nSolution: AI can analyze global economic patterns, advise governments and businesses on sustainable growth models, and help prevent reckless financial decision-making. AI access to real historical information is essential here.\nSmaller but Impactful Problems Human-Aligned AI Can Solve\nBusiness Decision-Making for Small Enterprises\nProblem: Many small business owners lack the experience or resources to analyze market trends, competitors, and hiring strategies effectively.\nSolution: AI can predict market trends, suggest hiring decisions, and optimize business strategies, helping small businesses scale more efficiently. For instance, LazAI can help optimize business operations and strategies based on past performance, market trends, and best industry practices.\nDecision-Making Challenges in DAOs\nProblem: Many DAO members lack the expertise to make informed governance decisions, leading to uninformed voting and low engagement.\nSolution: AI can educate DAO members on governance history, provide simulations of potential voting outcomes, and recommend the best courses of action. For instance, LazAI could analyze historical Metis CEG voting patterns, discussions, and Sybil activities, simulate outcomes of proposals, and recommend adjustments to maximize community benefit.\nThe Metis Ideology of AI + Human Collaboration presents a scalable, adaptable framework to solve problems across multiple levels\u2014from global governance to small business decisions.\nRisks and Safeguards\nWhile this model presents significant advantages, robust safeguards are required to prevent AI misuse. Please note that a problem is an opportunity for us to find a new solution:\nAI Bias and Neutrality\nFlaw: AI models are trained on historical data, often containing biases. Even decentralized AI can inherit biases from the sources it learns from, leading to potentially flawed recommendations.\nSolution: Implement LazAI\u2019s solutions where possible to ensure data and human alignment, and bias detection and mitigation mechanisms in the AI training process for non-LazAI data sources. Encourage diverse contributors to AI training and governance to minimize inherent biases.\nThe Grand Vision: Creating a Free and Happy Society\nThe Efficient and Balanced Alignment of AI and Humans is more than a concept\u2014it is a path to a more just, free, and prosperous society. By integrating AI as an ethical and knowledgeable advisor, we can build an ecosystem where decisions are made with wisdom, ensuring freedom, growth, and innovation.\nMetis has already laid the foundation through LazAI and MetisL2 via Decentralized Sequencers. Now, our mission is to align all stakeholders around this vision and demonstrate its power in action.\nMetis is not just another Web3 economy - we are leading the charge toward a decentralized, AI-assisted future that balances intelligence with human ethics.\nWe will create the future we believe in.",

This directly aligns with the ideology of a Balanced Tandem of AI and Humans, where AI serves as a knowledgeable advisor without exerting unchecked power.\nWith this robust foundation in decentralization, cross-chain interoperability, and a commitment to ethical AI governance, Metis is not just another Web3 platform - it is the ideal proving ground for a decentralized AI-human collaboration model that can reshape governance, businesses, and societies for the better.\nSolving Real Problems Through AI-Human Collaboration\nThe Metis ideal of the Efficient and Balanced Alignment of AI and Humans has the potential to solve a wide range of problems, spanning from global issues to smaller, yet impactful challenges within businesses and governance.\nGlobal Problems Human-Aligned AI Can Solve\nGlobal Political Inefficiencies & Misalignment with the People\nProblem: Governments often make uninformed, biased, or emotionally charged decisions that lead to war and economic disasters.\nSolution: AI can analyze historical data, predict geopolitical risks, and propose the best diplomatic strategies based on proven governance models. A decentralized, AI-assisted advisory system for world governance (similar to a non-corrupt UN) could reduce global conflicts by fostering educated, unbiased decision-making.\nLarge-Scale Problems Human-Aligned AI Can Solve\nInefficiencies in National and Corporate Governance\nProblem: Many decisions are made based on limited knowledge, leading to policy failures and mismanagement.\nSolution: AI can study historical cases from the original philosophy books and historical archives of successful and failed governance, offering data-driven insights that help decision-makers predict long-term outcomes.\nUnstable Economic Policies\nProblem: Economic crashes and crises often result from poor financial planning and short-term decision-making.\nSolution: AI can analyze global economic patterns, advise governments and businesses on sustainable growth models, and help prevent reckless financial decision-making. AI access to real historical information is essential here.\nSmaller but Impactful Problems Human-Aligned AI Can Solve\nBusiness Decision-Making for Small Enterprises\nProblem: Many small business owners lack the experience or resources to analyze market trends, competitors, and hiring strategies effectively.\nSolution: AI can predict market trends, suggest hiring decisions, and optimize business strategies, helping small businesses scale more efficiently. For instance, LazAI can help optimize business operations and strategies based on past performance, market trends, and best industry practices.\nDecision-Making Challenges in DAOs\nProblem: Many DAO members lack the expertise to make informed governance decisions, leading to uninformed voting and low engagement.\nSolution: AI can educate DAO members on governance history, provide simulations of potential voting outcomes, and recommend the best courses of action. For instance, LazAI could analyze historical Metis CEG voting patterns, discussions, and Sybil activities, simulate outcomes of proposals, and recommend adjustments to maximize community benefit.\nThe Metis Ideology of AI + Human Collaboration presents a scalable, adaptable framework to solve problems across multiple levels\u2014from global governance to small business decisions.\nRisks and Safeguards\nWhile this model presents significant advantages, robust safeguards are required to prevent AI misuse. Please note that a problem is an opportunity for us to find a new solution:\nAI Bias and Neutrality\nFlaw: AI models are trained on historical data, often containing biases. Even decentralized AI can inherit biases from the sources it learns from, leading to potentially flawed recommendations.\nSolution: Implement LazAI\u2019s solutions where possible to ensure data and human alignment, and bias detection and mitigation mechanisms in the AI training process for non-LazAI data sources. Encourage diverse contributors to AI training and governance to minimize inherent biases.\nThe Grand Vision: Creating a Free and Happy Society\nThe Efficient and Balanced Alignment of AI and Humans is more than a concept\u2014it is a path to a more just, free, and prosperous society. By integrating AI as an ethical and knowledgeable advisor, we can build an ecosystem where decisions are made with wisdom, ensuring freedom, growth, and innovation.\nMetis has already laid the foundation through LazAI and MetisL2 via Decentralized Sequencers. Now, our mission is to align all stakeholders around this vision and demonstrate its power in action.\nMetis is not just another Web3 economy - we are leading the charge toward a decentralized, AI-assisted future that balances intelligence with human ethics.\nWe will create the future we believe in."

The core concept is the \u201cEfficient and Balanced Alignment of AI and Humans,\u201d where AI acts as a highly knowledgeable advisor (\u201cModern Philosopher-King\u201d) to human decision-makers, enhancing wisdom without replacing human judgment. Metis aims to leverage its decentralized infrastructure to make this AI-human collaboration model a reality, believing it can solve various problems from global inefficiencies to DAO decision-making challenges, ultimately leading to a more just and prosperous society. The text also briefly touches upon risks like AI bias and the need for safeguards."

The topic at hand is one we can no longer ignore: the long-standing neglect of the Metis African Community.\nLet me be clear: the African community under Metis is dead. It has been for a very long time, and the silence around this issue is deafening. This isn\u2019t just my opinion; it\u2019s the undeniable truth. For a community that represents a continent teeming with untapped potential, vibrant culture, and some of the most resilient, innovative people on the planet, the lack of effort and attention is both disappointing and infuriating.\nI\u2019ve raised this issue before, even mentioning it recently on Metis CEG, and I\u2019ll say it again: we need change. We\u2019re not asking for miracles, just the bare minimum effort to ensure that the African community under Metis is alive, thriving, and contributing to the ecosystem.\nLet\u2019s get specific. I spoke with Nano, and we\u2019ve shared our frustrations. He has reached out to the people supposedly in charge of the African community, and guess what? He got the same cold shoulders I did. No real engagement. No events. No outreach. No X Spaces. Nothing. Just a ghost town with the occasional link dropped into a dead Telegram group. How is this acceptable?\nDo you know what\u2019s worse? We don\u2019t even know who the current \u201cAfrican community members\u201d are. If there are still any active members, they must be hiding because there has been no activity, no connection, no movement\u2014just radio silence.

We\u2019re not just talking about this for the sake of talking; we\u2019re ready to revive the Metis African Community and transform it into something that the entire Metis ecosystem can be proud of.\nAnd let\u2019s be real: this isn\u2019t about money. We\u2019re not asking for financial handouts or compensation. This is about doing what\u2019s necessary to unlock the potential of a community that has been criminally overlooked. We\u2019re willing to put in the work, but we need Metis\u2019 support and approval to move forward.\nIf we\u2019re being honest, the lack of response from the team managing the African community suggests something fishy might be going on. How do you justify doing almost nothing except dropping occasional links to Metis Spaces in the group? There are no events, no consistent engagement, no opportunities for African members to connect or grow. It\u2019s a disgrace, and it can\u2019t continue.\nWhat We Would Do If Given the Opportunity\nIf Metis supports us, here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do to revive and elevate the African community:\nHost Weekly X Spaces: Create a platform for African voices within Metis.

This project has proven that with the right vision, leadership, and dedication, it\u2019s possible to build a vibrant, active community that\u2019s both engaged and productive.

All we need is your trust and approval to make it happen on a larger scale.\nThe Clock Is Ticking\nIf nothing is done within a few days of this message, we\u2019ll have no choice but to conclude that Metis has completely neglected the African community and has no interest in changing that. It would be devastating to realize that a project with so much potential and ambition could turn its back on such a vital part of its global community.\nMetis claims to be about decentralization, empowerment, and community.

                "comment": "Hi Savagee,\nThank you for your thoughtful post and for taking the time to share your concerns and suggestions. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re deeply passionate about the African community within Metis, and I appreciate the effort you\u2019ve put into bringing this back into focus.\nA lot of what you\u2019ve said resonates with our broader goals as a global community. It is evident that, regions like LATAM, Vietnam, Africa, APAC, and India are embracing crypto at incredible rates, and we see the potential for Metis to grow in all these regions. The foundation\u2019s goal has always been to support the ecosystem as a whole, with resources distributed globally where they\u2019re needed most and we strive to always achieve them as evident in our on-chain metrics and Messari report.\nmessari.io \u2013 15 Jan 25\nMetis Q4 2024 Brief\nWhile the overall market environment fluctuated, Metis demonstrated steady progress through increased activity, notable partnerships, and strategic expansions.\nWhen it comes to hosting X Spaces, you don\u2019t need approval from the team to get started. Groups like VestaDAO have shown how effective community-led spaces can be, and these are great examples of what\u2019s possible when members take initiative. Spaces like theirs help drive discussions and build visibility, and we\u2019d love to see the same from the African community.\nFor in-person events like hackathons or workshops, our events team focuses on global initiatives to make sure anyone can participate, regardless of where they are. These events are designed to be inclusive and open to all, rather than region-specific.\nFor the big recognized industry events, Metis is almost always present, like the recent DevCon in Bangkok and upcoming EthDenver. Including Metis making a presence in EthSafari in Kenya, EthAccra in Ghana, and Africa Tech week in Cape Town South Africa.\nOnce again, thank you for raising these points and for continuing the conversation, even after reaching out via email. Your energy and commitment are exactly what we need in this ecosystem.\nThank you.\nElena."

                "comment": "I must address some key points that remain unspoken. More than 80% of Futurians and the individuals I\u2019ve successfully onboarded into Metis are Nigerians. Nigeria is one of the fastest-growing crypto hubs globally, yet it wasn\u2019t even mentioned in your response alongside regions like LATAM, Vietnam, and APAC. This omission speaks volumes and feels like a missed opportunity to recognize the potential and dedication that exists here. You people should really not be sleeping on NIGERIA!\nYou mentioned hosting X Spaces as a way to engage the community. While that\u2019s a great initiative, I can confidently say we\u2019ve hosted countless spaces dedicated to onboarding people into Metis. I\u2019ve personally gone above and beyond, pushing Metis relentlessly in these spaces. There\u2019s even evidence to back this up. Yet, almost every time someone new joins, their first question is, \u201cWhat is Metis?\u201d This highlights not just a lack of awareness but a lack of structural support to amplify these efforts. Asking us to do more without recognizing or directly supporting what has already been done feels disheartening.\nWhen it comes to events, the potential here is massive. If we hosted an event in Nigeria, with the community we\u2019ve already built, the turnout would be incredible. Nigeria is a crypto powerhouse, and the numbers speak for themselves. It\u2019s surprising that Metis hasn\u2019t leveraged this region more strategically, despite its potential to significantly boost the ecosystem.\nNow, on to Metis Africa itself: how exactly is \u201cMetis Africa\u201d supporting builders from this region? How is it encouraging Metisians? How many African projects has it supported or even highlighted? What is its purpose, if I may ask? Because from the outside, it\u2019s unclear what tangible impact Metis Africa has had. To make matters worse, the official Metis Africa account hasn\u2019t made an official tweet in almost a year! This gives the impression that the initiative is dead or dormant, which doesn\u2019t inspire confidence or engagement from the community here.\nA member of the Metis team once told me, \u201cwe have a very active Nigerian community.\u201d With all due respect, that statement feels completely disconnected from the reality on ground. The Nigerian Metis community barely exists in any structured or visible way. If not for the efforts of a few individuals like myself, there wouldn\u2019t be any presence at all.\nMetis has an incredible opportunity here, but for this potential to be unlocked, there needs to be direct recognition, support, and visible action. Builders and advocates like Nano and myself are willing to put in the work, but the foundation must meet us halfway by creating systems that genuinely support African builders and amplify our voices.\nThank you once again for taking the time to engage with this conversation. I remain committed to advocating for Metis and seeing it thrive in Africa - Nigeria to be precise, but I hope these concerns are addressed meaningfully so we can move forward together."

        "content": "1. Overview\nQuack AI is an AI-powered governance platform that enables smarter proposal participation through automatic summarization, voting recommendations, and intelligent delegation. Metis, as a Layer 2 scaling platform with a strong DAO foundation, is seeking to strengthen its governance system with increased forum engagement, deeper integration across tools, and a more informed voter base.\nThis proposal outlines a staged integration plan that leverages Quack AI\u2019s strengths to complement Metis\u2019s governance vision without replacing Snapshot too early. We propose starting with an MVP-focused approach that highlights AI analysis and bi-directional forum engagement, then progressively unlocks deeper functionalities.\n2. Current Capabilities\nQuack AI currently supports:\nSelf-hosted Voting Contracts with ERC-20 and ERC-721 token-based power\nMulti-token weighted voting with customizable weights per project\nAlso supports manual and API-based Voting Power configuration in collaboration with project teams. Projects can define token weights or voting logic if discussed in advance and corresponding data sources are provided.\nAI-Powered Proposal Analysis, providing:\nSummary\nPro/Con reasoning\nEvaluation across decentralization, feasibility, long-term impact\nDelegation System (Live by late May), supporting:\nUser-selected delegates or AI Agents\nDelegate tagging and historical position summaries\nMulti-Chain & Multi-Project Layout (BNB, Arbitrum, and more)\n3.

                "comment": "1. Overview\nQuack AI is an AI-powered governance platform that enables smarter proposal participation through automatic summarization, voting recommendations, and intelligent delegation. Metis, as a Layer 2 scaling platform with a strong DAO foundation, is seeking to strengthen its governance system with increased forum engagement, deeper integration across tools, and a more informed voter base.\nThis proposal outlines a staged integration plan that leverages Quack AI\u2019s strengths to complement Metis\u2019s governance vision without replacing Snapshot too early. We propose starting with an MVP-focused approach that highlights AI analysis and bi-directional forum engagement, then progressively unlocks deeper functionalities.\n2. Current Capabilities\nQuack AI currently supports:\nSelf-hosted Voting Contracts with ERC-20 and ERC-721 token-based power\nMulti-token weighted voting with customizable weights per project\nAlso supports manual and API-based Voting Power configuration in collaboration with project teams. Projects can define token weights or voting logic if discussed in advance and corresponding data sources are provided.\nAI-Powered Proposal Analysis, providing:\nSummary\nPro/Con reasoning\nEvaluation across decentralization, feasibility, long-term impact\nDelegation System (Live by late May), supporting:\nUser-selected delegates or AI Agents\nDelegate tagging and historical position summaries\nMulti-Chain & Multi-Project Layout (BNB, Arbitrum, and more)\n3.

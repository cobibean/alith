Every day brings new dApps, governance proposals, liquidity movements, and wallet activity. This pace is exciting, but it also creates one big challenge: how do you separate the signal from the noise?\nThat challenge is the reason ALPHA exists.\nWhat is ALPHA?\nALPHA is an AI agent built for Hyperion and Metis. Instead of spamming raw data, it continuously scans the chain in real time, applies AI logic to filter out irrelevant noise, and delivers only the signals that matter.\nThese include:\nNew dApp launches and contract deployments\nDAO votes and governance activity\nWhale and liquidity moves\nEarly scam and rug pull alerts\nIn other words, ALPHA is not just another monitoring bot. It is a watchtower for the ecosystem, designed to give communities, builders, and users the timing edge they need to act early and act smart.\nWhy Launch a Campaign?\nUntil now, ALPHA has been introduced through articles, discussions, and community conversations. But the best way to understand ALPHA is to experience it directly.\nThat\u2019s why we are partnering with Guild to launch the Xperience ALPHA Campaign. This campaign gives everyone the chance to interact with the AI agent, explore its signals, and share feedback. It is both an introduction and an invitation to shape how ALPHA evolves.\nHow to Get Involved\nParticipation is simple. Through Guild, you will:\nJoin and interact with ALPHA\nFollow the project on X for updates\nShare your experience with the community\nComplete the listed engagement tasks\nEvery completed step brings you closer to rewards while also helping the ecosystem test and refine the AI agent.\nWhy It Matters for the Community\nThe strength of Hyperion and Metis has always been its community of builders, users, and researchers. By opening ALPHA to direct interaction, we\u2019re creating a shared intelligence layer that benefits everyone, not just insiders. When more people have access to early, reliable signals, the ecosystem as a whole becomes safer, fairer, and stronger.\nJoin the Campaign\nThe Experience ALPHA Campaign is now live.\nJoin here : Alpha Alith\nStep into the signal.

From the beginning, our aim has been consistent: not to be another Layer 2, but to build infrastructure that evolves, experiments, and sets the direction for tomorrow. We began by scaling Ethereum and have steadily expanded toward a future where blockchain and AI move together.\nTraditional L2s need upgrading. That is why we built Hyperion, our AI-optimized infrastructure layer that raises throughput and lowers latency. But infrastructure alone is not enough. To bring communities in, we must layer playability and meaningful interactions on top.\nLazAI, our application and data layer, is where playability comes alive. It makes infrastructure interactive, aligns with market demand, and builds community confidence.\nMetis is the beta ground for new bets, the place where daring ideas are tested, refined, and scaled before they shape the industry at large. As we continue this path, we must grow together, anchored by trust and clarity.\nA Toolkit for One Economy: From Settlement to Playability\nMetis\u2019s strength is in its unity. We are not scattering value into silos; we are building a connected toolkit under one economy.\nAndromeda serves as the settlement and trading layer. Hyperion expands that base with scalable compute, optimized for AI dApps that demand high throughput and low latency. Together, they form the infrastructure. On top sits LazAI, serving as the application layer, transforming this foundation into playability, points, data, and AI-driven value.\nStep by step, the toolkit expands. Value builds as the layers connect. Recent milestones show this evolution in motion. Andromeda continues as the battle-tested motherchain. HyperHack drew more than 100 active Hyperion builders. LazAI Testnet launched with Lazbubu proving real playability. Our AI Companion DAT Lazbubu enrolled over 90k participants in the Whitelist Campaign and over 10,000 DAT mints.\nPutting Users First in the Journey\nParticipation begins with simple entry points that spark curiosity. From there, users move into richer experiences where AI, data, and community features make engagement meaningful.\nThe path is clear. LazAI incubates agents and applications through LazPad, while users earn, mint, and interact with data assets that mature into broader use cases on Andromeda. Lazbubu is the first step, showing how evolving AI Companions can anchor this journey.\nThese are not static NFTs, but AI agents that evolve over time, transforming innovation into experiences that align with market demand and foster confidence within our community.\nClosing\nAs I shared in a previous letter, our strength comes from trust and clarity. The earlier you take part in these new layers, the more your participation will guide their growth, and over time your efforts may be recognized in ways that matter.\nMetis is shaping the beta ground for the next era. With clear paths for participation through LazAI and Lazbubu, and with a culture that dares while staying principled, we are ready for what\u2019s next.\nThis is not the time to stand still. This is the time to lean in, experiment, and co-create the future.\nTogether, we will make Metis not just a network but the proving ground where tomorrow\u2019s breakthroughs are born.\n\u2014 Elena Sinelnikova",

        "content": "\u201cPersonal brand\u201d can sound like something influencers or startup bros talk about on LinkedIn, not something developers should care about. But here\u2019s the truth: whether you like it or not, you already have a personal brand. It\u2019s basically just what people remember about you after you leave the room (or close the laptop).\nThe trick is shaping that memory in a way that feels authentic and not like you\u2019re trying too hard. Here\u2019s how to do it without the cringe factor.\n1. Think \u201cReputation,\u201d Not \u201cBrand\u201d\nForget logos, taglines, or trying to act like a tech celebrity. For developers, a personal brand is just your reputation.\nDo people know you as \u201cthe person who\u2019s great at debugging\u201d or \u201cthe one who explains things simply\u201d?\nDo they think of you as reliable, helpful, curious, or innovative?\nThat\u2019s your brand, right there.\n2. Share What You\u2019re Learning (Even If It Feels Small)\nYou don\u2019t need to write a 5,000-word Medium essay to stand out. Tweet a bug you solved. Post a LinkedIn note about a tricky concept you finally understood. Record a 2-minute Loom explaining something.\nThe key isn\u2019t showing how smart you are. It\u2019s showing that you\u2019re learning and bringing others along with you. That\u2019s relatable, not cringe.\n3. Engage in Communities & Forums\nSome of the best personal branding happens where devs actually hang out, such as forums, Discord servers, GitHub discussions, Reddit, or local community spaces.\nAsk thoughtful questions instead of only lurking.\nJump in to answer when someone\u2019s stuck.\nShare resources or code snippets that genuinely helped you.\nCommunities are where reputations grow fastest. People remember the ones who consistently contribute in helpful, human ways.\n4. Give More Than You Take\nEngage with others outside your own content. Review someone\u2019s PR kindly. Leave a thoughtful comment on someone else\u2019s post. Share an article that isn\u2019t yours but you found valuable.\nYour personal brand grows significantly faster when people perceive you as generous rather than self-promotional.\n5. Lean Into Your Personality\nYou don\u2019t need to copy-paste \u201cthought leadership\u201d quotes. Be yourself. If you\u2019re funny, let that humour show in your posts. If you\u2019re more of a visual thinker, share diagrams instead of essays.\nAuthenticity > polish every single time.\n6. Consistency Beats Virality\nYou don\u2019t need one viral thread or YouTube video. You just need to show up consistently in small ways. Over time, people will associate you with your strengths, and opportunities will follow: jobs, collaborations, speaking gigs, you name it.\nThe Bottom Line\nBuilding a personal brand as a developer isn\u2019t about \u201cselling yourself\u201d or acting like an influencer. It\u2019s about showing up, being helpful, and letting your genuine personality come through in code, in posts, and in the communities where you spend time. Do that, and you\u2019ll build a reputation people respect without ever feeling like you\u2019re faking it.",

Share What You\u2019re Learning (Even If It Feels Small)\nYou don\u2019t need to write a 5,000-word Medium essay to stand out. Tweet a bug you solved. Post a LinkedIn note about a tricky concept you finally understood. Record a 2-minute Loom explaining something.\nThe key isn\u2019t showing how smart you are. It\u2019s showing that you\u2019re learning and bringing others along with you. That\u2019s relatable, not cringe.\n3. Engage in Communities & Forums\nSome of the best personal branding happens where devs actually hang out, such as forums, Discord servers, GitHub discussions, Reddit, or local community spaces.\nAsk thoughtful questions instead of only lurking.\nJump in to answer when someone\u2019s stuck.\nShare resources or code snippets that genuinely helped you.\nCommunities are where reputations grow fastest. People remember the ones who consistently contribute in helpful, human ways.\n4. Give More Than You Take\nEngage with others outside your own content. Review someone\u2019s PR kindly. Leave a thoughtful comment on someone else\u2019s post. Share an article that isn\u2019t yours but you found valuable.\nYour personal brand grows significantly faster when people perceive you as generous rather than self-promotional.\n5. Lean Into Your Personality\nYou don\u2019t need to copy-paste \u201cthought leadership\u201d quotes. Be yourself. If you\u2019re funny, let that humour show in your posts. If you\u2019re more of a visual thinker, share diagrams instead of essays.\nAuthenticity > polish every single time.\n6. Consistency Beats Virality\nYou don\u2019t need one viral thread or YouTube video. You just need to show up consistently in small ways. Over time, people will associate you with your strengths, and opportunities will follow: jobs, collaborations, speaking gigs, you name it.\nThe Bottom Line\nBuilding a personal brand as a developer isn\u2019t about \u201cselling yourself\u201d or acting like an influencer. It\u2019s about showing up, being helpful, and letting your genuine personality come through in code, in posts, and in the communities where you spend time. Do that, and you\u2019ll build a reputation people respect without ever feeling like you\u2019re faking it."

Most trading intelligence is centralized, opaque, and inaccessible to non-technical users. As a result, DeFi users frequently miss profitable opportunities or fall prey to volatility, lacking real-time, trustable AI-driven decision support.\nSolution Overview\nHyperMind AI transforms DeFi trading by delivering real-time, AI-generated trading signals directly within a web-based dashboard. Leveraging the Alith AI engine and Hyperion\u2019s AI-native blockchain infrastructure, it offers actionable insights such as BUY, HOLD, MONITOR, or YIELD FARM signals with confidence metrics, risk levels, and expected returns. The system simulates local inference for now, preparing for verifiable on-chain execution. It empowers users of all levels to trade smarter, safer, and faster using intelligence previously only available to professionals.\nProject Description\nHyperMind AI is a real-time DeFi trading assistant that simulates on-chain AI trading intelligence using AlithMock, a local inference engine designed to mirror the behavior of Alith AI. It displays AI signals based on multi-layer neural simulations, tracking entry/exit prices, confidence levels, and risk metrics. Users can interact with a responsive dashboard, execute or monitor trades, and analyze their portfolio in real time.\n\nCore Features:\nAI Signal Feed: Real-time BUY / STRONG BUY / MONITOR / HOLD signals\nConfidence Scores: Up to 98%, updated live\nAlith System Stats: Neural processing speed, win rate, network uptime\nPortfolio Insights: Asset breakdown, daily P&L, Sharpe ratio, AI win rate\nExecution Panel: Run simulated signal execution logic with wallet connection\nEmergency Stop / Auto-Rebalance: Simulated protection features\nTechnologies:\nFrontend: JavaScript + ethers.js\nSmart Contract-ready: Solidity architecture (WIP)\nBackend (simulated): AlithMock inference engine (browser-based)\nChain: Hyperion / Alt-Hyperion Testnet\nUsers can connect a wallet, interact with live signals, monitor returns, and experience AI-assisted DeFi trading with one click. The vision is to shift from static dashboards to truly intelligent DeFi experiences.\nWhat excites us: HyperMind AI is not just a UI\u2014it\u2019s an infrastructure-ready prototype for transparent, AI-native trading systems. As Alith AI matures, this frontend will seamlessly connect to on-chain inference engines, zkML proof generators, and real-time validators.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nTestable Features & Task System:\nConnect Wallet to Hyperion Testnet (+3 pts)\nMonitor Live AI Signals (+5 pts)\nExecute a Signal (Simulated) (+10 pts)\nTrigger Emergency Stop / Auto-Rebalance (+5 pts)\nRate Signal Accuracy After Use (+2 pts)\nPoints System:\nEach action grants points that accumulate in a leaderboard. Top testers may receive:\nEarly access to new signals\nNFT badges\nGovernance test tokens\nExplore:\nLive Demo: https://hypermind-ai.vercel.app/\nGitHub: https://github.com/JinyueXie/hypermind-ai\nDemo Video: https://youtube.com/watch?v=TVCFpXDk1e4\nLet\u2019s redefine AI-native DeFi \u2014 together.",

        "content": "We are thrilled to unveil a monumental leap in the development of Fracture Point, our upcoming tactical TPS game. While our interactive lobby prototype provides a glimpse into the player experience, the true revolution lies in the meticulously crafted on-chain smart contracts and the robust Alith Architecture that power our innovative Proof of Play ecosystem.\nThis past month has been dedicated to building the immutable bedrock of Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 capabilities, focusing on decentralized ownership, verifiable progression, and a player-driven economy.\nFracture Point: The Game Skill, Strategy, and True Digital Ownership\nFracture Point is designed as a high-octane, tactical third-person shooter that demands precision, strategic thinking, and teamwork. We are building a fiercely competitive environment where your skill and dedication are not just recognized, but are fundamentally integrated into the game\u2019s core value system.\nPrepare for:\nIntense FPS Combat: Master diverse weapon loadouts and tactical maneuvers in dynamic, high-stakes engagements.\nDeep Customization: Personalize your agents and unique \u201cvariants\u201d, making your mark on the battlefield.\nCompetitive Progression: Climb verifiable leaderboards, earn genuine rewards, and truly own your in-game achievements.\nThe Proof of Play Revolution: Rewarding Skill On-Chain\nOur commitment to Proof of Play is the defining feature of Fracture Point. This is not a concept; it\u2019s a core, on-chain mechanism ensuring that your active engagement and skillful performance directly translate into verifiable, immutable value and progression within the game\u2019s ecosystem.\nHow Proof of Play works in Fracture Point, powered by our contracts:\nVerifiable Achievements: Through the GameAchievementRegistry.sol contract (which is part of our ClaimManager system), your significant in-game achievements and progression milestones are immutably recorded on the blockchain. This provides transparent, provable recognition for your dedication and skill.\nSkill-Based Rewards: Our FPToken (FracturePoint Token), serving as XP, is minted to players based on their in-game performance (e.g., in Rift events), authorized exclusively by our trusted Alith Oracle. This ensures that rewards are earned through genuine gameplay.\nOn-Chain Progression & Badges: Your accumulated FPToken (XP) can then be burned via the ClaimManager contract to claim unique Rank Badges (ERC-721 NFTs) from the RankBadge.sol contract, signifying your seasonal achievements and skill tier. This process is entirely on-chain, making your rank verifiable and owned.\nPlayer-Driven Ecosystem: This interconnected system ensures that the game\u2019s economy and value are directly influenced and shaped by the collective activity and skilled contributions of its player base.\nThis ensures Fracture Point rewards genuine skill, time invested, and proven performance, fostering a fair, transparent, and truly player-owned gaming experience.\nOur Core Architecture: Dedicated Smart Contracts and The Alith Framework\nThe true innovation behind Fracture Point lies in its robust, interconnected smart contracts and the strategic implementation of the Alith Architecture.\n1. The Alith Architecture: Our Tailored Blockchain Game Framework\nFracture Point leverages a bespoke implementation of the Alith Architecture. This is our comprehensive, modular framework meticulously designed to seamlessly integrate blockchain technology without compromising gameplay performance. It intelligently separates:\nOn-Chain Components: Our smart contracts (FPToken, RankBadge, ClaimManager) handle critical, immutable data like XP (FPToken) balances, Rank Badge (NFT) ownership, and verifiable achievements. This ensures decentralization, security, and provable ownership. The Alith Oracle acts as the trusted off-chain authority that bridges game outcomes to on-chain actions, such as distributing XP and authorizing badge claims.\nOff-Chain Backend: High-frequency game logic, real-time matchmaking, complex physics calculations, and volatile player statistics run on a performant off-chain backend. This guarantees a smooth, low-latency, and responsive gameplay experience, unburdened by blockchain transaction times and gas costs.\nSecure Interoperability: A robust and auditable communication layer ensures seamless and secure data flow between our contracts (governed by the Alith Oracle) and the off-chain game server.\n2. Fracture Point\u2019s Core Smart Contracts (Audited & Interconnected)\nWe have successfully designed, developed, and prepared for deployment the foundational smart contracts that power Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 economy and the Proof of Play mechanics. These contracts work in concert:\nFPToken.sol (FuturePoint Token) : This ERC-20 token represents XP within the Fracture Point ecosystem. It\u2019s designed specifically for in-game progression:\nMinted by Alith Oracle: Only the designated alithOracle can mint new FPToken to players (e.g., via distributeRiftXP) based on game outcomes.\nBurned by ClaimManager: The ClaimManager contract is uniquely authorized to burn FPToken (XP) from player balances when they claim Rank Badges, creating a clear utility and economic loop.\nNon-Transferable (Player-to-Player): Significantly, direct player-to-player transfers of FPToken are disabled. This ensures FPToken remains a pure XP/progression token, preventing speculative trading and focusing its value on in-game achievement.\nRankBadge.sol (Fracture Point Rank Badge) : This ERC-721 NFT contract represents unique, season-specific Rank Badges that players can earn.\nMinted by ClaimManager: Only the ClaimManager contract is authorized to mint new Rank Badges to players, ensuring badges are earned through the proper Proof of Play mechanism.\nImmutable On-Chain Proof: Each badge is a unique NFT, providing verifiable, immutable proof of a player\u2019s achievement for a given season and rank.\nClaimManager.sol : This is the central orchestrator contract, linking FPToken (XP) to Rank Badges (NFTs) and acting as the bridge to the Alith Oracle.\nManages Badge Claims: Players claim badges via ClaimManager, which then verifies their XP balance, burns the necessary FPToken from their account, and instructs RankBadge.sol to mint the new NFT.\nSeason Management: It tracks the currentSeason, ensuring players can only claim one badge per season.\nKarma Evaluation Requests: It facilitates requests for off-chain \u201cKarma\u201d evaluations by the Alith Oracle, hinting at deeper player behavior analysis.\nAlith Oracle Integration: It designates and relies on the alithOracle for authorizing badge claims and distributing rewards based on verified game data.\nThe code for these foundational contracts and the full Alith Architecture implementation can be reviewed in our public repository: https://github.com/SUPAMAN-dev/fracture-point-hyperhack\nYou can also verify our currently deployed contract addresses on the Hyperion testnet network: https://hyperion-testnet.metisdevops.link/\nFPToken Address: 0x4D23a7A2231624F1486CE0dE07C2fbF002f751B9\nClaimManager Address: 0x1Dab96d049e3ce56D51e6B0b149477927B897FFb\nRankBadge Address: 0xBB84D771f6aef01f00dEE45D9C9dF9C7ef9159e5\n(Note on GHC: While not currently on-chain, the fixed supply GHC currency, managed by multisig, will form the broader economic layer of Fracture Point. Its design ensures seamless future integration with our on-chain systems when the time is right, complementing the FPToken XP system.)\nLobby Prototype: The Player\u2019s Interactive Gateway\nComplementing this powerful blockchain backend, our functional lobby prototype provides the intuitive player-facing interface. It allows players to:\nSeamlessly navigate between game modes, customization options, and personal profiles.\nExperience a polished UI/UX that aligns with Fracture Point\u2019s futuristic theme.\nInteract with the foundational elements for future wallet integration, demonstrating how players will connect their on-chain assets to the game.\nLink to the prototype demo: https://youtu.be/aI_lQ6DcwEI\nEcosystem Interest: Strategic Offer from Plurality Web3\nAs a direct result of our development efforts during this Hyperion Hackathon, Fracture Point attracted partnership interest from leading Web3 infrastructure teams, most notably Plurality Web3, a startup pioneering embedded identity and authentication infrastructure for dApps.\nPlurality offered us a 12-month support package under their Partner Program, which includes:\n1:1 Engineering Support for seamless integration of user authentication and personalized in-game logic.\nFree infrastructure credits to cover authentication, user session tooling, and zkTLS-powered identity gating.\nUX Collaboration to co-design smooth onboarding flows without popups or clunky wallets particularly valuable for our casual-to-core player conversion goals.\nTheir outreach came after they reviewed Fracture Point\u2019s Hyperion-backed Proof of Play system and saw clear potential for adoption in competitive Web3 gaming.\nWe view this offer as both validation of our underlying architecture and a strategic complement to the low-cost, high-throughput infrastructure that Hyperion enables. These ecosystem synergies affirm that Fracture Point is not just a playable demo, but a platform being taken seriously by early infrastructure players.\nWhat\u2019s Next for Fracture Point?\nWith the core blockchain architecture, smart contracts, and the lobby interface firmly established, our immediate next steps are to integrate these powerful systems with the actual game engine to bring the full combat experience to life. This includes:\nBackend Game Logic Development: Building out the sophisticated off-chain systems for real-time matchmaking, secure player data management, and robust anti-cheat measures.\nGame Engine Integration: Connecting the lobby and backend systems to a game engine to render the immersive world and high-fidelity combat of Fracture Point.\nProof of Play Loop Refinement: Fully integrating in-game actions with our GameAchievementRegistry.sol via the Alith Oracle to ensure every skill-based action is verifiable and contributes to player progression and potential future GHC earnings.\nThis is an incredibly exciting time for Fracture Point.

The Alith Architecture: Our Tailored Blockchain Game Framework\nFracture Point leverages a bespoke implementation of the Alith Architecture. This is our comprehensive, modular framework meticulously designed to seamlessly integrate blockchain technology without compromising gameplay performance. It intelligently separates:\nOn-Chain Components: Our smart contracts (FPToken, RankBadge, ClaimManager) handle critical, immutable data like XP (FPToken) balances, Rank Badge (NFT) ownership, and verifiable achievements. This ensures decentralization, security, and provable ownership. The Alith Oracle acts as the trusted off-chain authority that bridges game outcomes to on-chain actions, such as distributing XP and authorizing badge claims.\nOff-Chain Backend: High-frequency game logic, real-time matchmaking, complex physics calculations, and volatile player statistics run on a performant off-chain backend. This guarantees a smooth, low-latency, and responsive gameplay experience, unburdened by blockchain transaction times and gas costs.\nSecure Interoperability: A robust and auditable communication layer ensures seamless and secure data flow between our contracts (governed by the Alith Oracle) and the off-chain game server.\n2. Fracture Point\u2019s Core Smart Contracts (Audited & Interconnected)\nWe have successfully designed, developed, and prepared for deployment the foundational smart contracts that power Fracture Point\u2019s Web3 economy and the Proof of Play mechanics. These contracts work in concert:\nFPToken.sol (FuturePoint Token) : This ERC-20 token represents XP within the Fracture Point ecosystem. It\u2019s designed specifically for in-game progression:\nMinted by Alith Oracle: Only the designated alithOracle can mint new FPToken to players (e.g., via distributeRiftXP) based on game outcomes.\nBurned by ClaimManager: The ClaimManager contract is uniquely authorized to burn FPToken (XP) from player balances when they claim Rank Badges, creating a clear utility and economic loop.\nNon-Transferable (Player-to-Player): Significantly, direct player-to-player transfers of FPToken are disabled. This ensures FPToken remains a pure XP/progression token, preventing speculative trading and focusing its value on in-game achievement.\nRankBadge.sol (Fracture Point Rank Badge) : This ERC-721 NFT contract represents unique, season-specific Rank Badges that players can earn.\nMinted by ClaimManager: Only the ClaimManager contract is authorized to mint new Rank Badges to players, ensuring badges are earned through the proper Proof of Play mechanism.\nImmutable On-Chain Proof: Each badge is a unique NFT, providing verifiable, immutable proof of a player\u2019s achievement for a given season and rank.\nClaimManager.sol : This is the central orchestrator contract, linking FPToken (XP) to Rank Badges (NFTs) and acting as the bridge to the Alith Oracle.\nManages Badge Claims: Players claim badges via ClaimManager, which then verifies their XP balance, burns the necessary FPToken from their account, and instructs RankBadge.sol to mint the new NFT.\nSeason Management: It tracks the currentSeason, ensuring players can only claim one badge per season.\nKarma Evaluation Requests: It facilitates requests for off-chain \u201cKarma\u201d evaluations by the Alith Oracle, hinting at deeper player behavior analysis.\nAlith Oracle Integration: It designates and relies on the alithOracle for authorizing badge claims and distributing rewards based on verified game data.\nThe code for these foundational contracts and the full Alith Architecture implementation can be reviewed in our public repository: https://github.com/SUPAMAN-dev/fracture-point-hyperhack\nYou can also verify our currently deployed contract addresses on the Hyperion testnet network: https://hyperion-testnet.metisdevops.link/\nFPToken Address: 0x4D23a7A2231624F1486CE0dE07C2fbF002f751B9\nClaimManager Address: 0x1Dab96d049e3ce56D51e6B0b149477927B897FFb\nRankBadge Address: 0xBB84D771f6aef01f00dEE45D9C9dF9C7ef9159e5\n(Note on GHC: While not currently on-chain, the fixed supply GHC currency, managed by multisig, will form the broader economic layer of Fracture Point. Its design ensures seamless future integration with our on-chain systems when the time is right, complementing the FPToken XP system.)\nLobby Prototype: The Player\u2019s Interactive Gateway\nComplementing this powerful blockchain backend, our functional lobby prototype provides the intuitive player-facing interface. It allows players to:\nSeamlessly navigate between game modes, customization options, and personal profiles.\nExperience a polished UI/UX that aligns with Fracture Point\u2019s futuristic theme.\nInteract with the foundational elements for future wallet integration, demonstrating how players will connect their on-chain assets to the game.\nLink to the prototype demo: https://youtu.be/aI_lQ6DcwEI\nEcosystem Interest: Strategic Offer from Plurality Web3\nAs a direct result of our development efforts during this Hyperion Hackathon, Fracture Point attracted partnership interest from leading Web3 infrastructure teams, most notably Plurality Web3, a startup pioneering embedded identity and authentication infrastructure for dApps.\nPlurality offered us a 12-month support package under their Partner Program, which includes:\n1:1 Engineering Support for seamless integration of user authentication and personalized in-game logic.\nFree infrastructure credits to cover authentication, user session tooling, and zkTLS-powered identity gating.\nUX Collaboration to co-design smooth onboarding flows without popups or clunky wallets particularly valuable for our casual-to-core player conversion goals.\nTheir outreach came after they reviewed Fracture Point\u2019s Hyperion-backed Proof of Play system and saw clear potential for adoption in competitive Web3 gaming.\nWe view this offer as both validation of our underlying architecture and a strategic complement to the low-cost, high-throughput infrastructure that Hyperion enables. These ecosystem synergies affirm that Fracture Point is not just a playable demo, but a platform being taken seriously by early infrastructure players.\nWhat\u2019s Next for Fracture Point?\nWith the core blockchain architecture, smart contracts, and the lobby interface firmly established, our immediate next steps are to integrate these powerful systems with the actual game engine to bring the full combat experience to life. This includes:\nBackend Game Logic Development: Building out the sophisticated off-chain systems for real-time matchmaking, secure player data management, and robust anti-cheat measures.\nGame Engine Integration: Connecting the lobby and backend systems to a game engine to render the immersive world and high-fidelity combat of Fracture Point.\nProof of Play Loop Refinement: Fully integrating in-game actions with our GameAchievementRegistry.sol via the Alith Oracle to ensure every skill-based action is verifiable and contributes to player progression and potential future GHC earnings.\nThis is an incredibly exciting time for Fracture Point.

                "comment": "Thank you for your great question and your interest in MetaPay!\nLet me answer each part in detail:\n1. Transparent Interface for Recollection Tracking\nMetaPay is designed so that all users can track both the distribution and recollection of funds in real time through their digital wallets.\nAt the end of each month, users will be able to clearly see:\nThe amount recollected (10% of remaining balance)\nThe amount distributed\nCurrent wallet balance\nFull transaction and recollection history\nMonthly reports will also be provided via the mobile app or web-based wallet interface to ensure full transparency.\n2. About Personalizing the Recollection Rate\nMetaPay maintains a fixed 10% recollection rate for all users.\nThis is because the recollected amount is directly used as the fund for the next month\u2019s distribution.\nIf the rate were to vary by individual, it would break the balance of this self-sustaining cycle and threaten the long-term stability of the system.\nHowever, small demographic changes (such as births or deaths) can be handled through government budget adjustments or annual fiscal planning, without affecting the core 10% structure.\nIf you\u2019re curious about the full MetaPay model, please feel free to visit our YouTube channel.\nWe\u2019ve uploaded videos that explain the core mechanics and philosophy of MetaPay in detail:\nMain Intro Video\nMetaPay \u2013 A Circulating Basic Income: Whose Time Are You Living?\nhttps://youtu.be/e4lH_uGN-ck\nVisit Our Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@MetaPayProject\nThank you again for engaging with the project.

                "comment": "Thank you for your thoughtful questions! Let me explain each point clearly.\n1. What happens if a user withdraws all MetaPay before the 10% recollection at the end of the month?\nMetaPay is a closed-loop digital system that cannot be freely withdrawn as cash.\nAll MetaPay balances are managed within your digital wallet and cannot be transferred directly to others or exchanged into fiat currency.\nEven if you attempt to use up all of your balance before the end of the month, the system will calculate the recollection amount based on your wallet balance at that exact time (e.g., 10% of the remaining amount on the last day of the month).\nThis ensures fairness and sustainability, regardless of spending patterns.\n2. How does the automatic 50/50 split payment work between MetaPay and fiat currency?\nWhenever you make a payment at a registered merchant, your wallet automatically splits the transaction:\n50% is paid using MetaPay, and 50% using your existing payment method (cash, credit, etc.).\nThis is enforced by the system and does not require manual input by the user or merchant, maintaining simplicity and compliance.\nIt also ensures MetaPay is circulated and reclaimed properly within the system.\nWant to explore the MetaPay model in detail?\nCheck out the official video and YouTube channel, where we explain the philosophy and mechanism of MetaPay.\nIntro Video\nMetaPay Circulating Basic Income \u2013 \u201cWhose time is it, really?\u201d\n\uba54\ud0c0\ud398\uc774\uc21c\ud658\ud615 \uae30\ubcf8\uc18c\ub4dd : \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc740 \ub204\uad6c\uc758 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\uae4c?\nFull Channel\nYouTube\nMetaPay Project\nShare your videos with friends, family, and the world\nWe believe MetaPay is not just about distributing money\u2014\nit\u2019s about restoring your time, freedom, and dignity.\nLet\u2019s build this future together."

For instance:\nA small EU country with 5 million people could adjust the monthly benefit per person according to national GDP, while keeping the 10% recollection rule intact.\nThis makes MetaPay ideal for pilot testing in:\nSmall EU member states (e.g., Estonia, Slovenia, Portugal)\nDecentralized communities or digital welfare zones\nInternational policy labs with limited fiscal risk\nMetaPay proves that basic income can be self-sustaining, programmable, and globally adaptable\u2014without requiring new taxes.\nLet\u2019s co-create a fairer digital future that begins with circulation, not debt.\nComing next: Technical Architecture & DID-based Identity Integration (Bonus Track)"

Please let me know if that could be arranged\nThe video demo and DApp can be shared upon request. Feedback and collaboration welcome!"

Not only that, they are sometimes unable to track microtask completion in a trust minimized way and filter quality contributors without KYC or resumes.\nSolution Overview\nA decentralized platform where DAO\u2019s can post microtasks or bounties, and contributors submit work along with zk-proofs or attestations of skill. The system verifies completion and auto-rewards based on DAO rules.\nProject Description\nOur project, ProofDAO, is a decentralized platform that allows DAO\u2019s and Web3 projects to post microtasks (like design, dev work, translations, marketing) and have contributors complete them in a trustless, reputation-based way. The main goal is to let DAO\u2019s tap into global talent without having to rely on traditional CV or trust assumptions.\nThe platform works in a simple way that is DAO\u2019s create bounties with rewards, contributors submit their work along with some form of identity proof (either linking GitHub or Twitter, or basic on-chain reputation NFT) and upon approval, they get rewarded. We\u2019re also experimenting with simulating zero-knowledge proofs (or lightweight attestations) just to show how trustless verification of skills can work without fully revealing someone\u2019s identity.\nThe smart contracts will be deployed on Metis and the good thing is it\u2019s EVM compatible and gas fees are really low, which makes it perfect for micro-transactions. We\u2019ll also integrate the Metis DAC framework to show how actual DAO workflows can function on-chain. Frontend will probably be in Next.js with wagmi and rainbowkit for wallet connection.\nI think what excites us the most is that this idea is actually useful. It\u2019s not just another DeFi toy, DAO\u2019s do need better tools for trustless coordination, and this project could really help reduce friction for contributors trying to break into the space.\nHyperion\u2019s architecture gives us a powerful foundation to supercharge ProofDAO in several ways:\nAI Co-Agent for Task Validation: One of the trickiest parts of managing bounties or microtasks is ensuring submissions are both relevant and high quality. Hyperion\u2019s built-in AI co-agent could help us automate task review, either by helping DAO admins filter submissions or flagging ones that match historical patterns of excellence. This would reduce human workload while ensuring consistent quality control.\nOn-Chain AI & Data for Identity Verification: We\u2019re exploring ways to simulate ZK-proofs or lightweight attestations for contributor reputation. With Hyperion\u2019s AI and data pipelines directly on-chain, we can potentially streamline how contributor identities or skills are verified, without forcing full doxxing or heavy KYC. That means contributors can prove credibility without oversharing and DAOs still get the signal they need.\nReal-Time Interactions: Because we\u2019re enabling microtask coordination, the faster the response loop, the better the experience. Hyperion\u2019s low-latency infra lets us build a smoother, more dynamic interface where task submissions, approvals, and feedback can happen almost instantly critical for keeping contributors engaged and reducing friction in DAO workflows.\nScalable Gamification: Our leaderboard and rewards system relies on tracking a lot of small interactions (like submissions, reviews, account linking). Hyperion\u2019s performance and modularity would help us scale this system efficiently, especially during high community activity.\nIn short, Hyperion adds muscle to both the intelligence and real-time responsiveness of ProofDAO. It\u2019s a perfect match for what we\u2019re building.\nWe\u2019re applying for Track 1: AI-Native and Core-Aligned Projects.\nSpecifically, we align with:\nAI-Native dApps, since we plan to embed AI into the task evaluation and contributor support flows.\nHyperion AI Integration, as we\u2019re actively exploring use of the Hyperion co-agent to help DAOs handle microtask submissions and contributor vetting with minimal overhead.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nWe\u2019ll gamifying the platform by assigning points to key actions like creating a DAO, posting or submitting tasks, reviewing work and linking social accounts. Users earn badges and rank on leaderboards, making testing feel more like a game. This approach not only encourages full platform exploration but also drives organic onboarding by rewarding users for meaningful participation.\nGetting Involved\nPeople can reach out to me via my twitter handle (@i_dodgerini) or telegram (@riteshdas1).

        "content": "Haithe\nA Decentralized Protocol for Verifiable AI.\nThe Problem\nThe core challenge for AI in Web3 isn\u2019t just proving that data hasn\u2019t been tampered with; it\u2019s proving the data\u2019s substance. A cryptographic hash can guarantee a dataset\u2019s integrity, but it cannot verify its origin, quality, or content.

Thanks again for your interest in our project and for the thoughtful questions. Let me address each of them below\n1) If the dataset is private, how do you ensure Auditors don\u2019t misuse or leak it?\nGreat question. In our current model, auditors must undergo two layers of validation before they\u2019re granted access:\nFirst, they are verified by us (the platform) based on identity and domain expertise.\nSecond, they are validated by the DAO, ensuring community-level accountability.\nWhile trust in auditors is still required to some extent, just like in real-world auditing , we are actively exploring ways to make this process more trustless.\n2) Are Creators allowed to challenge an audit report if they think it\u2019s unfair or inaccurate?\nYes, it\u2019s a crucial safeguard.\nWe agree that auditors shouldn\u2019t have unchecked authority. Creators will have the ability to challenge audit reports, either by:\nRequesting a re-audit (potentially by a different auditor or group of auditors), or\nSubmitting a formal rebuttal that gets appended to the audit report for transparency.\n3) What kinds of use cases are you targeting first \u2013 trading bots, oracles, LLMs?\nOur initial focus is on trading bots and LLMs. These use cases have both high impact and urgent need for trust and verifiability."

                "comment": "Helloo, Apologies for the delayed response, I really appreciate your thoughtful question!\nAs a consumer, audits are exactly what enable trust that an AI agent\u2019s data truly comes from the sources claimed. Each audit report goes into technical detail, verifying every claim made in the agent\u2019s Claim Manifest \u2014 like the data source, date range, schema, and more.\nAnd yes, confidence naturally increases when multiple auditors review the same dataset. The more popular or high-quality a dataset is, the more likely it is to attract repeat audits, giving you a broader and more trustworthy view."

        "content": "Introduction\nThe first edition of the Metis Telegram Text AMA launched with a focus on the Hyperion Forum and the ongoing Guilds Campaign. Hosted by Norbert from the Metis community team, the session welcomed Daryl, a member of the Metis Governance group, who unpacked the design, incentives, and future direction of the Forum and Guilds structure.\nHere\u2019s a full recap of the session in chat-style format.\nAMA Transcript\nNorbert: What is the Hyperion Forum and how is it different from other blockchain communities? Who is it designed for?\nDaryl: The Hyperion Forum is a collaborative space for all contributors\u2014builders, marketers, and operators\u2014to work together on dApps within the Metis ecosystem. Unlike many blockchain communities that cater mainly to devs, the Forum offers structured Guilds to support all roles involved in launching successful projects. It\u2019s built on Discourse and includes gamified features like badges and a points system. It\u2019s also the home for HyperHack, our $200K hackathon.\nNorbert: How do Guilds work inside the Forum? Can someone join more than one?\nDaryl: Guilds are like subreddits within the Forum\u2014dedicated spaces for Builders, Marketers, and Operators. Anyone can view content, but to post or comment, you\u2019ll need to officially join a Guild. To do so, click \u201cjoin here\u201d in the Guilds section, answer a short form, and you\u2019ll be approved within 24\u201348 hours. You\u2019re free to join multiple Guilds, especially if you wear many hats like a founder.\nNorbert: Tell us about the points and reputation system.

Long-term, Guild Leaders could receive METIS token incentives, expanded governance roles, early access to new features, and scaled rewards based on their Guild\u2019s performance.\nNorbert: What responsibilities will Guild Leaders have?\nDaryl: Guild Leaders manage membership, moderate posts, set permissions, and guide their communities.

                "comment": "Introduction\nThe first edition of the Metis Telegram Text AMA launched with a focus on the Hyperion Forum and the ongoing Guilds Campaign. Hosted by Norbert from the Metis community team, the session welcomed Daryl, a member of the Metis Governance group, who unpacked the design, incentives, and future direction of the Forum and Guilds structure.\nHere\u2019s a full recap of the session in chat-style format.\nAMA Transcript\nNorbert: What is the Hyperion Forum and how is it different from other blockchain communities? Who is it designed for?\nDaryl: The Hyperion Forum is a collaborative space for all contributors\u2014builders, marketers, and operators\u2014to work together on dApps within the Metis ecosystem. Unlike many blockchain communities that cater mainly to devs, the Forum offers structured Guilds to support all roles involved in launching successful projects. It\u2019s built on Discourse and includes gamified features like badges and a points system. It\u2019s also the home for HyperHack, our $200K hackathon.\nNorbert: How do Guilds work inside the Forum? Can someone join more than one?\nDaryl: Guilds are like subreddits within the Forum\u2014dedicated spaces for Builders, Marketers, and Operators. Anyone can view content, but to post or comment, you\u2019ll need to officially join a Guild. To do so, click \u201cjoin here\u201d in the Guilds section, answer a short form, and you\u2019ll be approved within 24\u201348 hours. You\u2019re free to join multiple Guilds, especially if you wear many hats like a founder.\nNorbert: Tell us about the points and reputation system. How does it work and what do contributors get out of it?\nDaryl: Every meaningful action\u2014posting, replying, helping others, inviting members, etc.\u2014earns you points and badges. These are tracked publicly on the leaderboard. Over time, we\u2019ll introduce onchain benefits tied to these contributions. You can learn more in the Badge and Point System Guide on the forum.\nNorbert: What\u2019s the purpose behind the Guilds Campaign? Why are Guilds so important to the long-term vision?\nDaryl: The goal is to create specialized, high-signal communities where project teams can find support, share challenges, and scale together.

Manual trading is emotionally taxing, requires constant market monitoring, and demands technical analysis skills many users lack. Additionally, traders struggle to maintain consistent strategies, often shifting approaches based on emotion rather than data, leading to suboptimal results.\nSolution Overview\nLazaiTrader is an intelligent multi-agent trading system accessible through Telegram that allows users to select specialized AI trading personas, each with distinct strategies and risk profiles. The system continuously analyzes market conditions and either generates actionable buy/sell signals or automatically executes trades across major DEXs based on user preference. Built on the same robust Alith framework infrastructure, LazaiTrader adapts to market conditions while maintaining the user\u2019s selected trading philosophy, effectively bringing institutional-grade trading strategies to retail users through a familiar messaging interface.\nProject Description\nLazaiTrader transforms crypto trading by allowing users to select from various AI trading personas, each representing different trading philosophies and strategies. Whether you prefer momentum trading, swing trading, technical analysis, or contrarian approaches, LazaiTrader provides a suite of specialized AI agents to match your preferred style.\nCore features include the \u201cPersona Selection\u201d system allowing users to choose trading philosophies that match their temperament, \u201cStrategy Visualization\u201d showing potential entry/exit points before execution, and \u201cDual-Mode Operation\u201d offering either signal-only notifications or fully automated trade execution. The system leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) technology and the Alith framework to maintain coherent understanding across interactions, remembering user preferences, portfolio composition, and past decisions.\nThe platform is designed to integrate with major DEXs like Uniswap v3 and can adapt to available liquidity sources. Our algorithms move beyond traditional indicators like moving averages which might not be as reliable in volatile crypto markets. Instead, we use momentum-based strategies that capitalize on emerging trends before they become obvious, volatility-adaptive approaches that dynamically adjust position sizes based on market conditions, and liquidity flow analysis to identify smart money movements before price reacts.\nUsers can select specific asset-focused strategies including Blue Chip Trader (focusing on BTC, ETH, METIS and other established cryptocurrencies) or Micro Cap Trader for those seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in emerging tokens. Each persona combines these strategy elements differently based on their trading philosophy.\nUsers interact with the system through a natural, conversational interface that explains complex trading strategies in accessible terms tailored to each user\u2019s demonstrated technical understanding. What makes LazaiTrader particularly valuable is its recognition that bull markets favor active trading strategies rather than passive yield farming approaches, allowing users to capitalize on market momentum through their preferred trading style. The system even suggests transitioning to yield strategies when market indicators suggest bearish conditions ahead, providing a complete crypto asset management solution.\nCommunity Engagement Features\nPersona Selection (50 points): Users select their first trading persona and complete the initial risk assessment. No wallet connection required at this stage.\nFirst Trading Signal (100 points): Users receive their first trading signal through the platform. All signals are recorded server-side for performance tracking even without wallet connection.\nWallet Connection (75 points): Users connect their wallet for additional features and functionality.\nRisk Adjustment (50 points): Users modify their risk parameters and observe how their trading persona adapts.\nReferral Program (25 points per referral): Users earn points by inviting others, with bonus points when referred users complete their first trade.\nTrading Performance Achievements (variable points): Users unlock badges and points when their strategies reach specific ROI thresholds.\nThis gamification approach creates clear milestones for users while educating them about different trading methodologies.

It\u2019s because the tools to proactively defend against live attacks simply don\u2019t exist. Audits are static, expensive, and quickly outdated. Most teams are forced to choose between shipping fast or staying safe.

On Metis, it can integrate with the Optimistic Rollup\u2019s fraud-proof system to catch and challenge malicious transactions, with optional ZK proofs to verify integrity without revealing contract internals.\nThreat severity will be determined using multiple sources, primarily ScrawID, a repository of known smart contract exploits used by tools like Slither and Mythril.

It\u2019s noisy, but still powerful for reach.\nOn the private web, people are leaning into closed communities like Discord, Telegram, Substack, and group chats where they trust the source, not the algorithm.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean the public internet is dead. Far from it. It\u2019s still where discovery happens. But the trust? The real conversations?

                "comment": "I recently watched a TikTok video describing a shift I think a lot of us are feeling even if we haven\u2019t put it into words yet: The internet is splitting into two layers - the public and the private.\nOn the public web, content is everywhere, often AI-generated, fast, and recycled. It\u2019s noisy, but still powerful for reach.\nOn the private web, people are leaning into closed communities like Discord, Telegram, Substack, and group chats where they trust the source, not the algorithm.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean the public internet is dead. Far from it. It\u2019s still where discovery happens. But the trust? The real conversations? The long-term belief? - They\u2019re increasingly moving behind the curtain.\nWhat This Means for Web3 Marketing\nWeb3 is all about community, but we often default to a single layer of strategy:\nPost on X\nAirdrop for engagement\nTry to go viral\nWhat if we added layers instead of relying on one shot?\nPublic web layer => Spark curiosity, build surface-level awareness\nPrivate spaces layer => Nurture trust, convert belief into belonging\nOnchain layer => Align actions with value in a provable, transparent way\nInstead of choosing between the two, the most effective strategies embrace both: Use threads or videos to spark ideas\u2026 Then guide people into Telegrams, forums, or token-gated spaces where they can go deeper.\nThe internet is changing.

It\u2019s not just about driving people in anymore, it\u2019s about designing spaces where they feel seen, safe, and curious enough to stick around. I think the future of community will hinge on that, not just reach, but resonance."

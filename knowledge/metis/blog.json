This is a significant step in our commitment to greater transparency and community engagement. We're also proud to introduce Daniel Kwak, who serves as both the Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) of Metis and the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) of LazAI. This dynamic leadership team is part of our enhanced strategy to connect more deeply with our community and partners as we enter this transformative phase.The Dawn of a New Blockchain EraOur recent AMA session featuring Tom, Natalia, and Daniel delivered compelling insights into Metis Hyperion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a breakthrough development poised to redefine how blockchain and AI converge. The team shared their vision for a technology that doesn't just improve upon existing solutions but fundamentally expands what's possible.Tom described Hyperion in terms that captured its groundbreaking potential: \"a high-performance AI-targeted infrastructure\" built specifically for tomorrow's demands. His analogy resonated strongly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 traditional blockchain technology is comparable to a 3G wireless network, while Hyperion represents \"5G LTE and moving on to 6G.\" This isn't just an incremental improvement; it's a significant leap forward that addresses the fundamental limitations that have held blockchain adoption back in critical sectors.Reimagining AI for a Decentralized WorldNatalia shared our bold \"ReGenesis\" vision, which she powerfully described as \"a rebirth of Metis in the era of AI.\" She highlighted a pressing challenge in today's tech landscape: AI is developing within a \"centralized bubble\" where a handful of tech giants control our data, models, and algorithms \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a situation that demands disruption.This is where blockchain technology becomes a game-changer. Our team envisions blockchain and AI as \"complementary and synergetic technologies,\" with blockchain having \"great potential to elevate AI, bring it to the next level, and help with addressing some of the key issues such as trust, verifiability, equal access.\" This is more than just improving technology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it's about democratizing the future of AI.Daniel cut through the noise to explain why Hyperion matters now: \"What we found was a gap in the industry where we saw that the needs of AI weren't really truly being met by any of the incumbents.\" Rather than chasing trends, Hyperion is filling a critical market need that no one else has properly addressed.Two Powerful Networks, One Unified EcosystemMany community members have asked how Hyperion will work alongside our established Andromeda network. Let's be clear: these networks are designed to complement each other, not replace one another. Tom explained this relationship thoroughly, noting that the two networks will operate in parallel, with Andromeda providing widespread access (like 3G) while Hyperion delivers specialized high-speed capabilities (like 5G/LTE) for specific high-performance applications.\"The two networks will work in parallel,\" Tom emphasized, with both powered by the METIS token. This is crucial to understand \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Hyperion will use METIS as its gas token, and there are no plans to launch a separate Hyperion token. This creates a cohesive, unified ecosystem despite the different technical capabilities of each network.Daniel elaborated that Andromeda will continue as the trusted \"general purpose all use case Web3 network\" with its proven track record of decentralized sequencing (dSeq) and progression toward Stage 1, while Hyperion will serve \"almost like a halo\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 attracting attention and innovation with its high-performance capabilities specifically optimized for AI applications. Each network serves distinct needs within our growing ecosystem, creating synergies that strengthen the entire Metis ecosystem.Performance That Shatters ExpectationsHyperion's technical specifications aim to be industry-defining. With 1-2 gigagas per second processing power, Hyperion represents a giant leap in blockchain capabilities. Natalia explained what this means in tangible terms: \"unprecedented scalability, ultra-low latency, and also of course very high throughput\" creating advantages for both developers and users that simply weren't possible before.For everyday blockchain users, this delivers an \"almost Web2-like speed experience, which removes the lag and congestion and of course the high fees from blockchain interactions.\" For developers, it eliminates the constraints that have limited innovation, opening doors to applications that were previously unthinkable on blockchain.MetisVM: The Powerhouse Driving AI IntegrationAt the heart of Hyperion lies the groundbreaking MetisVM (Metis Virtual Machine), which Natalia described as \"a high-performance virtual machine developed to enhance the integration of artificial intelligence within a decentralized framework.\"While maintaining seamless compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), MetisVM introduces several advanced features specifically engineered for AI applications:Strategic separation of computing and storage functions for optimized performancePowerful support for parallel execution enabling unprecedented throughputHighly efficient dynamic code optimization reducing computational costsInnovative state-aware caching for faster data access and processingThese capabilities bridge the gap between blockchain and AI while creating \"an open and scalable decentralized infrastructure\" ensuring AI development remains \"transparent, verifiable, and aligned with human goals\" rather than controlled by centralized entities.Parallel Execution: The Key to Unlocking AI PotentialDaniel explained how Hyperion's parallel execution fundamentally transforms transaction processing, describing it as \"having multiple queues of transactions executing at the same time with mutual exclusion, while ensuring consistency between the results of serial and parallel execution.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThis capability is absolutely critical for data-intensive AI applications, particularly model training that demands processing vast amounts of information simultaneously \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a requirement that traditional blockchain architectures simply cannot meet.Real-World Applications That Will Transform IndustriesThe team highlighted several immediate applications that stand to be transformed by Hyperion's capabilities:Next-Generation DeFi and TradingTom emphasized how Hyperion will transform trading by solving the critical limitations in speed and throughput that have kept traditional finance from fully embracing blockchain. \"In traditional finance, trading timing is everything because the market moves fast,\" he noted \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a challenge that Hyperion is uniquely positioned to address, potentially unlocking billions in traditional finance value.Unleashing High-Frequency Trading on BlockchainDaniel explained that high-frequency trading \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a multi-billion dollar industry in traditional finance \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has been essentially impossible on blockchain due to network limitations. Hyperion changes this equation completely, potentially bringing this massive market segment into the blockchain ecosystem.AI Training and Inference at ScaleBy supporting onchain AI inference and machine learning models with unprecedented performance, Hyperion enables developers to create sophisticated AI applications with blockchain's security and transparency advantages \u00e2\u0080\u0093 applications that could fundamentally change how AI is developed, verified, and trusted.The Exciting Road AheadOur ReGenesis roadmap is accelerating quickly. Daniel shared that Hyperion's testnet is expected between late April and mid-May 2025, with the mainnet following around August. We're developing comprehensive campaigns for both users and developers to drive early adoption and showcase Hyperion's transformative capabilities.A key element of our strategy involves LazAI, which we're closely incubating. LazAI tackles the critical \"data alignment problem\" in AI, ensuring training data properly aligns with intended model outcomes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a perfect complement to Hyperion's infrastructure advantages.Daniel confidently articulated our vision: \"Regardless of how big we are and how big our competitors are, it's pretty much going to be irrefutable that Hyperion will be one of the top homes for AI,\" displaying the ambition behind this initiative and a clear-eyed assessment of the unique value Hyperion brings to the market.Be Part of the FutureMetis Hyperion represents an ambitious effort to create specialized blockchain infrastructure optimized for AI applications. By addressing the unique requirements of AI workloads through high-performance architecture, parallel execution, and optimized data handling, our roadmap aims to position Hyperion as the backbone of decentralized AI development.As Natalia concluded: \"Our vision is really to make Hyperion become the backbone of decentralized AI. But this is our vision, our approach. But it's up to you, our community, our supporters, and our developers to jump on that and really build it out and show what the new world with decentralized AI can look like.\"The future of blockchain-AI integration is taking shape now \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and we invite you to be at the forefront of this exciting new frontier.Related PostTechnologyThe Buzz About BEES: Meme Token with a MissionEcosystemMetis Launches its DAOtribution Grants Campaign on KORIS!Follow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

Traditional Layer 2 solutions, though an improvement over Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s base layer, still struggle with congestion, centralized sequencers, and limited adaptability for AI-driven workloads.Hyperion (HYPE) is built to break through these limitations. Designed specifically for AI developers, DeFi protocols, and gaming applications, Hyperion is an ultra-fast, AI-optimized Layer 2 blockchain that eliminates the compromises of traditional rollup solutions. It introduces a high-performance modular rollup architecture, providing real-time execution, parallel processing, decentralized sequencing, and seamless Ethereum interoperability. With Hyperion, developers gain access to scalability without trade-offs, ensuring that complex applications perform at Web2-like speeds without sacrificing decentralization or security.Hyperion achieves 1-2 gigagas per second, making it one of the highest-performing Layer 2 solutions that will be available for AI engineers building in Web3.Hyperion vs. Andromeda: A Dual-Chain EcosystemHyperion is not replacing Andromeda, the existing Metis Layer 2 network, but rather expanding Metis' ecosystem with a specialized, high-performance infrastructure. While Andromeda serves as the general-purpose Layer 2 platform for Ethereum dApps, Hyperion introduces a more advanced modular rollup architecture tailored for high-frequency, AI-powered applications. This dual-chain strategy ensures that Metis can support the full spectrum of Web3 applications, offering tailored infrastructure solutions without compromise.Why Hyperion MattersLet's delve into why Hyperion is critical for the future of AI + Web3 applications and how its innovations solve fundamental issues that have long plagued Ethereum Layer 2 solutions.MetisVM: The AI-Optimized Virtual MachineAI applications require substantial computational power, and standard Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) are not designed to handle the high-performance execution demands of AI models. Hyperion introduces MetisVM, a custom-built virtual machine optimized for on-chain AI inference and high-throughput dApps.How MetisVM accelerates smart contract execution:Dynamic Opcode Optimization: Smart contract execution is enhanced with dynamically optimized opcodes, reducing gas fees and improving efficiency.Speculative & Parallel Execution: AI-powered dApps can predict, precompute, and execute certain actions in parallel, greatly increasing processing speed.State-Aware Caching: Instead of fetching redundant data repeatedly, MetisVM caches frequently accessed information, ensuring faster execution times for AI and high-performance applications.Why it matters: AI developers can now run machine learning models, inference engines, and data-driven smart contracts natively on-chain, something that was previously impossible without off-chain solutions.Instant, Parallelized Transaction Processing: Hyper-ScalabilityTraditional Layer 2 solutions operate using a sequential transaction execution model, creating performance bottlenecks under high demand. Hyperion introduces a Parallel Execution Engine with an Optimistic Rollup model that enables real-time, concurrent transaction processing, a necessity for AI driven, gaming, and high-frequency DeFAI applications.\u00c2\u00a0How Hyperion achieves real-time execution:Optimistic Model: Transactions are initially assumed valid and settled quickly, with fraud-proof mechanisms ensuring network integrity.Parallel Execution Engine: Unlike traditional blockchain architectures, Hyperion allows multiple transactions and smart contracts to execute at the same time, significantly reducing delays and increasing scalability.Optimized Fraud-Proof Mechanisms: Unlike traditional Layer 2 solutions where fraud proofs can slow down execution, Hyperion optimizes fraud-checking processes, making the network both fast and secure.Why it matters: High-performance applications like on-chain AI, decentralized gaming, and real-time trading require sub-second execution times.

HYPE is a next-generation, high-performance Layer 2 network designed to optimize scalability, decentralization, and real-time transaction efficiency.\u00c2\u00a0Built on the Metis SDK, the core of Metis Hyperion (HYPE) is the high-performance virtual machine MetisVM, which is compatible with Ethereum and provides corresponding infrastructure support for AI applications. It offers unparalleled efficiency and performance for executing smart contracts such as DeFi, onchain gaming, and AI inference.\u00c2\u00a0MetisVM's multi-layered architecture ensures three critical elements: uncompromising security, seamless scalability, and enterprise-grade reliability. Optimizing for traditional smart contracts and AI-specific operations enables MetisVM to create the foundation that powers the Metis Hyperion ecosystem.Hyperion architecture introduces a high-throughput, low-latency architecture representing a fundamental advance in blockchain performance, enabling AI applications and complex DeFi operations that were previously impossible at scale.While Andromeda remains the foundation of Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ecosystem, Hyperion (HYPE) brings a modular and adaptable rollup architecture, catering to high-frequency DeFi, gaming, and AI-driven workloads. This marks a significant evolution for Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, delivering unprecedented speed, decentralization, and interoperability.Why Metis Hyperion?Ethereum Layer 2 solutions have improved scalability, but existing rollups still face critical limitations, including centralized sequencers, network congestion, and rigid gas payment models. Hyperion directly addresses these challenges by introducing:Optimistic Rollup & Parallel Execution: Real-time transaction processing and near-instant finality.Decentralized Sequencer Network: A fair, scalable, and censorship-resistant system that optimizes AI workloads.Ethereum Settlement & Cross-Chain Interoperability: Ensuring seamless liquidity movement and compatibility with Ethereum and other blockchains.Hyperion's specialized infrastructure enables AI applications to achieve performance previously impossible on blockchain networks.Hyperion is pioneering new possibilities for a Layer 2\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is designed to be the first AI-optimized rollup, enabling AI-native computation, decentralized sequencing, and seamless cross-chain asset movement.Key TechnologyOptimistic Rollup & Parallel ExecutionHyperion integrates parallelized transaction execution with an Optimistic Rollup model, significantly increasing transaction throughput and reducing latency. The execution model employs:Block-STM-based Parallel Execution: Processes multiple transactions simultaneously, eliminating traditional bottlenecks.Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC): Reduces rollback overhead, optimizing execution efficiency.Dynamic DAG Scheduling: Ensures optimal transaction sequencing for AI and high-frequency applications.Hyperion's parallel execution architecture fundamentally transforms the economics of complex smart contract operations, particularly for data-intensive applications. By processing multiple transactions simultaneously through Block-STM and optimistic concurrency control, computing resources are utilized with unprecedented efficiency. This translates directly to lower gas costs for users. Protocols with complex calculations benefit from similar efficiencies.\u00c2\u00a0The system's dynamic DAG scheduling further optimizes resource allocation by intelligently grouping non-conflicting transactions, ensuring maximum throughput while minimizing computational waste. For developers, this cost efficiency opens new possibilities for onchain applications that would be prohibitively expensive on other networks.\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008bDecentralized Sequencer NetworkUnlike traditional rollups that rely on centralized sequencers, Hyperion (HYPE) will move to a fully decentralized sequencer model, distributing sequencing responsibilities dynamically to prevent MEV attacks, censorship, and single points of failure.Leader Rotation Mechanism: Ensures fair, distributed sequencing to prevent monopolization.MEV-Resistant Ordering: Encrypted mempools & Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) eliminate front-running and unfair advantages.AI Optimization: Dynamically allocates sequencer resources for AI-powered applications.Ethereum Settlement & Cross-Chain InteroperabilityHyperion remains fully secured by Ethereum while offering multi-chain connectivity:Optimized Ethereum Settlement: State commitments to Ethereum for long-term security.Shared Bridge & Cross-Chain Compatibility: Seamlessly connects assets and liquidity across multiple chains.Native Paymaster Support (Coming Soon): Allows gas payments in ETH, USDC, and USDT, lowering entry barriers for mainstream adoption.Hyperion & Andromeda: A Multi-Network FutureMetis Hyperion (HYPE) and Andromeda will coexist within the Metis ecosystem, serving distinct yet complementary roles:Andromeda: Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 first and most established Layer 2, optimized for general-purpose decentralized applications (DApps).Hyperion (HYPE): A high-performance, AI-native execution layer prioritizing speed, decentralized sequencing, and AI-driven workloads.This multi-network approach ensures that developers and enterprises have the flexibility to deploy applications tailored to their specific needs, benefiting from Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shared Layer 2 technology.METIS Token Multi-chain UtilityThe METIS token sits at the center of the ecosystem's economic model, capturing value and maintaining utility on both Andromeda and Hyperion networks through multiple mechanisms. As the native gas token for all transactions across both chains, METIS maintains consistent demand regardless of which network users choose.\u00c2\u00a0This dual-network utility creates a unified economic system where transaction volume from AI-intensive applications on Hyperion and general DApps on Andromeda both contribute to token value. This multi-chain approach ensures that as the ecosystem expands, METIS token utility strengthens proportionally across all network activities.Long-term Ecosystem Growth and Value ExpansionMetis' dual-network strategy represents a forward-thinking approach to sustainable ecosystem growth. Rather than forcing all applications onto a one-size-fits-all solution, the complementary nature of Andromeda and Hyperion allows each to specialize while contributing to the whole. This creates natural expansion paths for projects as they evolve - starting with standard DApps on Andromeda and later incorporating AI components through Hyperion.The approach also insulates the ecosystem from market cycles by diversifying use cases across different technological domains. As general DeFi applications provide reliable baseline activity, AI applications drive innovation and new growth frontiers. A balanced, dual-network foundation creates long-term resilience while still enabling cutting-edge development.Hyperion RoadmapHyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rollout follows a structured development timeline:Feb - April 2025: Testnet Launch \u00e2\u0080\u0093 High-performance sequencer nodes go live.May - August 2025: Mainnet Launch \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Hyperion introduces its decentralized sequencer network and high-throughput Layer 2 framework.Sept - Dec 2025: Mainnet Upgrade \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Advanced execution optimizations, enabling instant feedback and parallel efficiency.ConclusionMetis Hyperion (HYPE) is redefining AI and Web3 integration, bringing Ethereum a high-performance, AI-optimized Layer 2 that enhances scalability, decentralization, and user experience.

The space has seen major shifts, from the early ICO boom to the rise of NFTs, DAOs, and DeFi. Each wave introduced new layers of utility, drawing attention and capital while laying the foundation for what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next.\u00c2\u00a0Now, another powerful wave is forming: AI. Artificial Intelligence has transcended early expectations and hype cycles, proving its ability to drive real value across almost every domain including Web3. Similar to how DeFi experienced its hype cycle during DeFi Summer, but its core principles and applications have remained foundational. AI follows a similar trajectory: beyond speculation, it delivers real-world utility across industries, streamlining operations, improving decision-making, and unlocking new possibilities for automation.AI's impact isn't limited to a single use case. Whether it's predictive analytics, natural language processing, or decentralized autonomous agents, AI has an application in almost every sector. This broad applicability makes AI a compelling force in Web3, where efficiency, automation, and scalability are crucial.So why is Metis betting on AI? Because there is a clear gap in blockchain infrastructure that is capable of supporting AI-driven applications at scale. AI thrives on data, and blockchain offers a unique opportunity to provide transparent, verifiable, and decentralized data sources. By aligning blockchain with AI, Metis is creating an ecosystem where AI projects can operate more effectively and securely, while also benefiting from the decentralized principles that Web3 offers.Moreover, the timing couldn't be better. With the U.S. easing restrictions on AI and crypto, the regulatory landscape is becoming more favorable. This opens the door for rapid development and adoption. Web3 has been searching for its next big wave, and AI could be the catalyst to bring in mainstream adoption beyond just crypto-native users. Metis recognizes this opportunity and is positioning itself at the forefront of AI-powered blockchain innovation, ensuring AI has everything it needs to scale within Web3.But recognizing the opportunity is not enough. Now, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dive deeper into the \"why.\" Why is Metis taking this bold step?\u00c2\u00a0Our Strategy: Bridging the Gap in AI + CryptoThe intersection of AI and blockchain is still in its infancy, and while many blockchain projects acknowledge AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential, most are missing the mark entirely. Instead of addressing the real infrastructure challenges that AI developers face, they are throwing money at the problem, hoping hype will be enough to carry them forward. This kind of strategy doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just fall short, it creates systemic risk, leading to unsustainable bubbles similar to the 2000 dot-com crash or the speculative DeFi boom of 2021.Where Others Are Falling ShortGrants & Hackathons \u00e2\u0086\u0092 Many blockchain projects are resorting to grants and hackathons, believing that a burst of developer activity will lead to meaningful AI adoption. But this is just temporary engagement, without long-term infrastructure, these projects have nowhere to go after the funding runs dry. What happens when the incentives end? The builders leave, and the so-called AI revolution on these chains fizzles out.New AI-Focused Layer 1s \u00e2\u0086\u0092 The most dangerous trend in AI+Crypto is the sudden emergence of AI-focused Layer 1 blockchains. While this may seem like a bold innovation, it is an incredibly high-risk gamble. History has shown that launching a new Layer 1 is difficult, most fail to achieve critical mass, leading to abandoned ecosystems and wasted developer effort. If these AI-specific chains fail, every project built on them is at risk. The foundation crumbles, and the entire ecosystem collapses with it.Minor Token Upgrades \u00e2\u0086\u0092 Adjusting tokenomics to \u00e2\u0080\u009cincentivize AI\u00e2\u0080\u009d without addressing fundamental technical limitations is a band-aid, not a solution. Some networks slap AI-related buzzwords onto governance models, tweak a few incentive mechanisms, and claim they are AI-ready.The result? A chaotic landscape where projects are chasing hype rather than building sustainable AI ecosystems. If this trend continues, a handful of projects may survive, but without fundamental infrastructure, the majority will struggle to gain real adoption.AI developers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need more speculative schemes, they need robust, scalable infrastructure that allows them to deploy real applications. Very few blockchain projects are focusing on the actual computational demands of AI: high-speed processing, decentralized storage, and secure data verification.Metis understands these pitfalls and is taking a fundamentally different approach, one that goes beyond throwing money at the problem. Instead, Metis is focused on providing the infrastructure AI projects actually need to scale. This is where our two-pronged strategy comes into play.Our Commitment: A Two-Pronged ApproachMetis is not just another blockchain chasing the AI hype, we understand the real gaps in the industry, and we are building to address them. AI models are data-intensive, high-speed, and demand real-time computation. Traditional blockchains weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t built for this level of execution. Developers need an environment where their AI applications can actually run without breaking.Our approach is grounded in delivering actual utility for AI builders by focusing on two critical areas:1. Providing Infrastructure AI Developers NeedBuilding AI-native applications is about giving developers the infrastructure they actually need to scale AI on-chain. AI projects require a high-performance execution layer, reliably high throughput, and a seamless developer experience. Without these, AI simply cannot function effectively on blockchain. This is exactly what Metis provides.\u00c2\u00a0High Throughput & Low Latency: AI workloads aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like standard Web3 applications. They require constant iteration, rapid processing, and fast decision-making. Whether it's AI-driven trading, autonomous agents executing contracts, or real-time DeFi optimizations, speed is everything. High transaction finality and low-latency execution are non-negotiable.A Stable, Reliable Network: AI-driven applications rely on consistency. Unlike human users, who can adapt to occasional congestion or high fees, AI models need a predictable and stable execution environment. If AI models experience unpredictable gas fees, downtime, or network congestion, their decision-making becomes flawed.\u00c2\u00a0Infrastructure Beyond Blockchain: AI applications require an ecosystem, not just a chain. For AI to be truly effective in Web3, developers need access to decentralized compute, storage, and indexing services. Without these services, AI developers struggle with fragmented data silos.2. Solving AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hardest Problems: Data MisalignmentOne of the most pressing issues in AI today is data misalignment, the inability of AI systems to align with human values and intentions due to flawed or incomplete training data. AI models rely on supervisory signals to learn, but these signals are often corrupted or missing, leading to outputs that fail to address real-world needs or ethical considerations. This results in AI-generated misinformation, bias, and hallucinations, issues that degrade trust and limit AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usability in high-stakes applications.Metis, through its incubation of LazAI, is directly addressing these issues. By leveraging blockchain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transparency and verifiability, LazAI ensures that AI models can access structured, high-quality, and decentralized data sources. This not only mitigates data misalignment but also provides an open and collaborative ecosystem where AI applications can function with greater trust and reliability.Additionally, AI projects require interoperability and ease of integration with Web3 ecosystems. Metis has developed Alith, a blockchain-native AI agent framework through LazAI, enabling AI-powered applications to seamlessly function across multiple networks. This enhances their usability, adaptability, and real-world applicability, making it easier for AI models to integrate with decentralized finance, governance, and gaming platforms.The Future of AI & MetisThe fusion of AI and blockchain is only just beginning, and the possibilities ahead are vast. The same way DeFi transitioned from a speculative experiment into an essential component of every blockchain, AI will become a native intelligence layer that powers everything from on-chain automation to real-time decision-making and beyond.But here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the key: AI needs a home built for it.For AI to fully integrate into Web3, it requires an environment that matches its computational needs, eliminates friction, and allows it to operate without barriers.\u00c2\u00a0That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what Metis is enabling.By building an ecosystem designed specifically to support AI, Metis is not just addressing the challenges of today, we are setting the foundation for the innovations of tomorrow. AI thrives when it has the right infrastructure to grow, and with Metis, AI developers are no longer constrained by network limitations, computational inefficiencies, or unreliable data sources.The future is not about forcing AI to adapt to blockchain. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about giving AI the home it deserves, one where it can truly scale, explore, and redefine what is possible in the decentralized world. Metis is leading this charge, ensuring that AI isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just another trend in Web3, but a fundamental force shaping the next era of innovation.Related PostTechnologyTEB and B-Harvest Launch on Metis as Third External Decentralized Sequencer Node OperatorCommunityThe Summer of MetisFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!
